# General Trade-offs & Decision Matrix

## The 5 Critical Trade-off Dilemmas

### 1. Thermal Efficiency vs. Acoustic & Fire Performance (Wall Insulation)
**Conflict:** Achieving Passivhaus-level thermal efficiency in a small footprint requires Polyisocyanurate (PIR) boards, which have excellent thermal conductivity (0.022 W/mK) but poor sound-dampening and fire ratings. In contrast, Stone Mineral Wool provides excellent acoustic isolation (crucial for woodworking noise near property boundaries) and is non-combustible, but requires double the wall thickness, eating into valuable floor space.

### 2. Passivhaus Airtightness vs. High-Volume Dust Extraction
**Conflict:** Passivhaus design relies on an ultra-sealed, airtight envelope with MVHR (Mechanical Ventilation with Heat Recovery) to maintain heat and a strict 45% humidity level (vital for rust prevention on hand tools). However, standard woodworking dust extraction violently exhausts massive volumes of air. Venting outside creates severe negative pressure, destroying the thermal envelope, while internal recirculation risks blinding the MVHR's sensitive filters with fine "dust flour."

### 3. Machine Load Capacity vs. DIY Site Access (Foundations)
**Conflict:** A concrete slab provides the best damp-proof barrier and sheer compressive mass to absorb the vibrations of heavy woodworking machinery. However, transporting wet concrete or heavy aggregate down a 30m, wheelbarrow-wide path is a logistical nightmare for a solo builder and is highly carbon-intensive. Ground screws solve the access and carbon issues instantly but complicate the goal of having the floor perfectly level with the outside patio, and require engineered load-spreading for heavy point loads.

### 4. Acoustic Mass vs. Solo Builder Logistics (Soundproofing)
**Conflict:** True acoustic isolation ("room-within-a-room") requires extreme mass, such as 42kg high-density Fermacell boards. The conflict arises because maneuvering and installing these massive sheets solo down a narrow side-passage is physically prohibitive. Switching to smaller "one-man" boards makes the build possible but drastically increases the number of joints—each one a potential failure point for both sound leakage and airtightness.

### 5. Coastal Weather Defense vs. Structural Breathability (Envelope System)
**Conflict:** SIPs (Structural Insulated Panels) offer a rapid 5-7 day watertight shell, protecting the wood from Cowes' coastal saline moisture, and easily hit Passivhaus airtightness targets. However, they are a "sealed" system; any compromised joint traps moisture, leading to rot. Traditional timber framing allows the building to "breathe" and dry naturally but takes weeks to build, leaves the frame exposed to unpredictable coastal rain, and makes extreme airtightness harder to achieve.

## Decision Matrix

| Choice | Pros | Cons | Cost Impact |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Insulation: PIR Boards** | Thinner walls (more internal space), superior Passivhaus thermal efficiency. | Poor soundproofing, flammable (Class E/F). | Moderate (£) |
| **Insulation: Mineral Wool** | Excellent acoustic dampening, A1 fire rating, breathable. | Requires 2x thickness (loses floor space), lower R-value per inch. | Low-Moderate (£) |
| **Extraction: External Venting** | Removes 100% of fine dust, saves interior space. | Destroys airtightness, massive heat loss, requires complex makeup air. | Moderate (£) |
| **Extraction: Internal Recirculation** | Maintains Passivhaus thermal envelope and neutral pressure. | Frequent expensive HEPA filter changes, requires bulky cyclone setup. | High (££) |
| **Foundation: Concrete Slab** | Best vibration damping, easy flush patio threshold, high load capacity. | Nightmare access (30m wheelbarrow), high carbon, weeks of curing time. | High (££) |
| **Foundation: Ground Screws** | Solo DIY friendly, zero curing time, low eco-impact. | Harder to match flush patio height, requires subfloor insulation detailing. | Moderate (£) |
| **Envelope: SIPs** | Extremely airtight, fast weather-tight shell (protects from coastal rain). | Zero breathability (moisture trap risk), heavier to maneuver solo. | High (££) |
| **Envelope: Timber Frame** | Breathable cavity, flexible for solo DIY alterations, lighter materials. | Harder to make airtight, slow build leaves it exposed to coastal rain. | Moderate (£) |

## Phase 2: Finalized Insights & Chosen Strategy (Feb 2026)

After interrogating the trade-offs, the following project philosophy has been established:

**1. The Foundation & Heating Insight:** 
The user accepted the logistical penalty of a concrete slab pour to gain the long-term benefits of vibration damping, flush patio alignment, and massive thermal mass. By halting construction for 4 weeks post-pour, the user mitigates the severe risk of trapping curing moisture in the timber frame. The slab will act as a constantly heated "thermal battery," which pairs perfectly with future solar PV integration.

**2. The Envelope & Acoustic Insight:** 
Timber framing (with an external continuous insulation layer, rather than Twin-Stud) is the chosen structure. The user sacrifices internal floor space for deep acoustic mineral wool and will rely on a meticulously taped internal Vapour Control Layer (VCL) instead of breathable external insulation. This demands absolute perfection in the taping phase but guarantees Passivhaus airtightness.

**3. The Entryway & Envelope Integrity Insight:**
Symmetrical French doors have been completely eliminated. The user recognized the fatal acoustic and thermal flaw of the meeting stile. The design will utilize an **Asymmetric (1.5) Door system** (1000mm active leaf + 400-600mm bolted slave leaf). This provides daily airtightness and soundproofing matching a single door, while still allowing a 1.4m+ opening for heavy machinery and 8x4 sheet goods when necessary. A Lift-and-Slide system remains a high-budget premium alternative.
