# Decisions Log: Workshop "Philosophy" and Core Choices

## Established Principles (As of Feb 2026)

1. **Acoustics over Space:** The user prioritizes soundproofing over maximizing internal floor space. Open to external continuous insulation to offset internal footprint loss.
2. **Thermal Efficiency First:** High thermal performance (Passivhaus-level) is the priority, accepting higher upfront costs. Dust extraction will utilize an internal recirculation system (with high-grade HEPA and cyclone separation) to preserve the thermal envelope.
3. **Foundation Strategy:** Insulated Concrete Raft. Provides maximum thermal mass, vibration dampening for heavy machinery, and allows for a flush transition to the existing outside patio.
4. **Labor & Logistics:** The user is willing to hire temporary contractors for critical heavy-lifting phases (e.g., moving heavy acoustic boards like Fermacell, or pumping/barrowing concrete on pour day).
5. **Structural Envelope:** Traditional Timber Frame for walls and roof. Chosen for breathability, flexibility, and ease of DIY modification, despite the slower weather-tightness timeline compared to SIPs.
6. **Vapour Management:** A meticulously taped internal Vapour Control Layer (VCL) will be the primary defense against interstitial condensation. This locks the moisture out of the wall structure.
7. **Wall Build-Up:** Single timber frame with external continuous insulation (Twin-stud rejected). Heavy cladding will require engineered structural fixings through the insulation.
8. **Heating Strategy:** The insulated concrete slab will be continuously heated to a baseline temperature to protect tools and act as a thermal battery. This aligns perfectly with future plans for solar+battery.
9. **Roof Design:** "Warm Roof" methodology (insulation entirely *on top* of the timber joists). The user accepts a lower internal ceiling height to safely stay under the 2.5m Permitted Development limit while eliminating roof condensation risks.
10. **Construction Timeline:** A deliberate 4-week halt will be scheduled immediately after pouring the concrete raft to allow full curing and drying before timber framing begins.
11. **Door Access Strategy:** French Doors are strictly eliminated due to acoustic and airtightness failures at the meeting stile. The primary design will utilize an **Asymmetric "1.5" Door system** (1000mm main active leaf + 400mm-600mm bolted slave leaf). This provides Passivhaus-level sealing 99% of the time, while allowing a 1.4m+ clear opening for machinery and 8x4 sheet goods when unbolted. (A premium Lift-and-Slide system is kept as an upgrade option if the budget allows).
