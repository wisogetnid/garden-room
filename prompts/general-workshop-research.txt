I'm building a 4m by 5m surfaced, 2.5m high garden-room in Cowes, UK. Permitted development and planning permission have been validated already, don't research this area. I will use the garden room as a wood workshop with mostlly hand tools. In a later stage, I plan to add solar panels to the roof.
Besides a requirement to keep the humidity below a certain point to protect the tools, I want to create an highly energy-efficient garden room, something akin to a passivehaus.  
I will build the garden-room mostly by myself, during evenings and weekends. The access to the site behind our house passes by the side of our house, is only about a wheelbarrow wide and roughly 30m from the parking lot in front of our house.
