# Climate Control Strategy: Garden Workshop (Cowes, UK)

## Executive Summary
For a 4m x 5m highly insulated timber garden room in Cowes, UK, used as a wood workshop, the primary challenge is managing humidity (rust prevention) and ensuring rapid comfort during intermittent use. While Infrared (IR) panels offer instant localized heat, an Air-to-Air Heat Pump (AAHP) is recommended as the primary system due to its superior efficiency (COP > 3), dehumidification capabilities, and cooling for summer. Phase Change Materials (PCM) can be added to the internal envelope to provide thermal mass, smoothing temperature spikes without the structural weight of concrete.

## 1. Physics of Heating a Small, Detached Timber Structure
*   **Thermal Mass:** Timber frame structures typically have low thermal mass. They heat up quickly (low energy to raise air temp) but cool down quickly once heating stops.
*   **Insulation & Airtightness (Passivhaus Standard):** High insulation (U-values < 0.15 W/m²K) and airtightness retain heat generated by tools, lighting, and occupants.
*   **The "Flask" Effect:** A highly insulated, airtight box traps moisture. In a workshop, this moisture comes from timber drying, glue, and respiration. Without active removal, relative humidity (RH) will rise, risking tool corrosion (keep RH < 55%).

## 2. Infrared (IR) Heating Panels vs. Air-to-Air Heat Pumps (AAHP)

### Infrared (IR) Panels (Radiant Heating)
*   **Mechanism:** Emits thermal radiation that heats surfaces (floor, bench, tools, skin) directly, not the air.
*   **Pros:**
    *   **Instant Comfort:** Feels warm immediately, like stepping into sunlight.
    *   **Silent & Static:** No fans, no dust movement (excellent for finishing/varnishing).
    *   **Simple Install:** Plug-and-play, no external unit.
*   **Cons:**
    *   **1:1 Efficiency:** 1kW input = 1kW output (COP = 1).
    *   **No Dehumidification:** Does not remove moisture.
    *   **Shadowing:** Only heats what it "sees". Under-bench areas remain cold.

### Air-to-Air Heat Pumps (AAHP / Mini-Split) (Convective Heating)
*   **Mechanism:** Moves heat from outside air to inside (or vice versa). Heats the air volume.
*   **Pros:**
    *   **High Efficiency:** 1kW input = 3-5kW output (COP 3-5).
    *   **Dehumidification:** "Dry" mode actively removes moisture, protecting cast iron beds on lathes/saws.
    *   **Cooling:** Essential for small, highly insulated spaces in summer to prevent overheating.
    *   **Air Filtration:** Filters fine dust (though distinct from a dust extractor).
*   **Cons:**
    *   **Air Movement:** Can blow dust around if not positioned carefully.
    *   **Noise:** Minimal (modern units ~20dB), but not silent.
    *   **Install:** Requires F-Gas certified installer.

### Comparison: Heat Up Time vs. Energy Usage

| Scenario | System | Heat Up Characteristics | Energy Usage |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Intermittent (8h/day)** | **IR Panel** | **Instant**. turn on 5 mins before use. Heats user, not room. | **High Peak**. Runs at full power (e.g., 2kW) while occupied. Zero when off. |
| **Intermittent (8h/day)** | **AAHP** | **Fast (Air)**. 15-30 mins to raise air temp. | **Low Avg**. High initial draw, then modulates down to maintenance (e.g., 300W). |
| **Continuous (24/7)** | **IR Panel** | Not applicable (would heat fabric eventually). | **Very High**. Expensive to maintain 24/7 temp with COP=1. |
| **Continuous (24/7)** | **AAHP** | Stable. Maintains background temp (e.g., 12°C) efficiently. | **Very Low**. Inverter technology runs low and slow. Best for protecting tools from condensation. |

## 3. Phase Change Materials (PCM)
To mimic the thermal mass of a masonry building in a timber structure without the weight/concrete, Phase Change Materials can be used.

*   **How it works:** PCM boards (e.g., Bio-PCM or salt hydrate mats encapsulated in plastic) melt at a target temperature (e.g., 23°C). As they melt, they absorb massive amounts of latent heat. When the room cools (night), they re-solidify, releasing that heat back into the room.
*   **Application:** Installed behind the plasterboard/OSB lining on walls or ceiling.
*   **Benefits for this Project:**
    *   **Summer:** Absorbs peak afternoon heat, preventing the "oven effect" common in garden rooms.
    *   **Winter:** Releases stored solar/heating energy in the evening, extending the "warm period" after the heater is off.
*   **Data:** A 15mm layer of PCM board can provide the equivalent thermal mass of ~100mm of concrete.
*   **Cost/Benefit:** Expensive compared to standard mass (plasterboard), but effective for passive regulation in lightweight structures.

## 4. Recommendations for Cowes Workshop
1.  **Primary System:** **Air-to-Air Heat Pump (2.5kW unit)**.
    *   *Why:* The critical requirement is protecting hand tools from rust (Cowes maritime humidity). Only AAHP provides active dehumidification and cheap background heat (e.g., maintain 12°C constantly to stop condensation).
2.  **Supplementary:** Small **IR Panel (600W)** over the main workbench.
    *   *Why:* For those short 30-min evening tasks where you don't want to heat the whole volume but want warm hands.
3.  **Thermal Mass:** Install **12mm OSB + 12.5mm dense plasterboard** (e.g., SoundBloc) as a cost-effective localized thermal mass. If budget permits, add **Bio-PCM mats** to the South/West walls to buffer solar gain.
