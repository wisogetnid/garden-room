# Insulation & Climate Strategy: Cowes Coastal Workshop

## 1. Executive Summary
For a 20m² woodworking workshop in Cowes, UK, used primarily during evenings and weekends, a **"Hybrid" insulation strategy** combining PIR board and a radiant barrier (multi-foil) is recommended. The "High Thermal Inertia" concept is actually *counter-productive* for intermittent heating; a **low thermal mass** interior with high radiant reflectivity will provide the fastest warm-up times. 

A **Warm Roof** construction is critical to prevent interstitial condensation given the 5-degree pitch and coastal humidity.

## 2. "High-Thermal-Inertia" vs. Quick Response
*   **Clarification**: "High Thermal Inertia" (e.g., exposed blockwork, concrete) stores heat but takes hours to warm up. For a workshop used for 2-4 hours in the evening, this results in the room only reaching comfort temperature as you leave.
*   **Recommendation**: **Low Thermal Inertia** (Lightweight).
    *   Insulate internally with materials that isolate the thermal mass of the structure from the internal air.
    *   Use a radiant barrier (foil face) immediately behind the internal lining (or as the lining) to reflect heat back to the user instantly.

## 3. PIR (100mm) vs. SuperFOIL SF40: Comparative Analysis

| Feature | 100mm PIR (e.g., Celotex/Kingspan) | SuperFOIL SF40 (Multi-foil) | Hybrid (75mm PIR + Foil) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **R-Value (Approx)** | ~4.50 m²K/W | ~3.58 m²K/W (w/ air gaps) | **~5.50 m²K/W** |
| **Mechanism** | Conductive resistance | Radiant reflection + air pockets | Best of both |
| **Warm-up Speed** | Moderate (heats air first) | **Fast** (radiant heat felt instantly) | **Very Fast** |
| **Thickness** | 100mm | 65mm + battens (approx 100mm) | ~100mm total |
| **Air Tightness** | Hard to seal perfectly at edges | Excellent (continuous roll) | Excellent |

### Warm-up Time Calculation (2kW Heater, 5°C -> 18°C)
*   **Scenario**: 5°C external/internal start temp. Target 18°C. 2kW Fan Heater.
*   **Physics**: 
    *   Air Volume: 50m³. Heat Capacity: ~1.2 kJ/m³K. Energy to heat air = 780 kJ.
    *   Surface Area: ~65m² (Walls + Roof + Floor).
*   **PIR Only**: The heater must heat the air *and* the surface of the lining (e.g., 12mm Ply/Plasterboard). 
    *   *Est. Time to Comfort*: **45-60 minutes**. The walls will "suck" heat from the air until surface temp rises.
*   **SuperFOIL / Hybrid**: The foil barrier reflects ~95% of radiant heat. Even if air is 10°C, the user *feels* warmer due to radiant reflection.
    *   *Est. Time to Comfort*: **20-30 minutes**.

**Strategy**: Use 70-80mm PIR between studs, and a continuous layer of SuperFOIL (or simple VC Foil) across the face. This provides high R-value AND the radiant benefit.

## 4. Dew Point & Flash Rusting Risk
*   **Coastal Risk**: Cowes has high average humidity (often >80% RH).
*   **Dew Point**: At 18°C / 70% RH, dew point is 12°C. Any surface below 12°C will form condensation.
*   **Cast Iron Tools**:
    *   **Flash Rusting**: Occurs when warm, moist air (e.g., from heating a cold workshop) hits cold metal surfaces (tools) that lag in temperature.
    *   **Mitigation**:
        1.  **Vapour Control Layer (VCL)**: **CRITICAL**. Must be continuous and taped on the *warm* side of the insulation. Use high-quality foil tape. Prevents moisture driving into walls.
        2.  **Tool Protection**: Cover tools with cotton sheets when not in use (buffers temp changes). Apply Camellia oil or paste wax.
        3.  **Heating**: Don't let the workshop drop to ambient temp if possible. A background tube heater (80W) near the tool cabinet can keep tools slightly above ambient, preventing condensation.
        4.  **Dehumidification**: A desiccant dehumidifier is superior to compressor types in low temps (<15°C).

## 5. Roof Construction: Cold vs. Warm (5° Pitch)
*   **Constraint**: 5-degree pitch is very shallow. Airflow in a "Cold Roof" (ventilated gap above insulation) relies on thermal buoyancy, which is weak at low pitches.
*   **Risks**:
    *   **Cold Roof**: High risk of dead air pockets in the ventilation gap. Moist air from the room leaking into this gap will condense on the cold underside of the OSB/EPDM deck. **NOT RECOMMENDED** for Cowes.
    *   **Warm Roof**: Insulation is placed *on top* of the roof deck. The structural deck remains warm (internal temp).
*   **Recommendation**: **Warm Roof**.
    *   Structure: Joists -> OSB Deck -> VCL -> PIR Insulation (100mm+) -> EPDM/Fibreglass.
    *   Pros: Eliminates interstitial condensation risk. No ventilation required.
    *   Cons: Adds ~120mm to height.

## 6. Breathable Membranes & Coastal Resistance
*   **Challenge**: Salt spray crystals are hygroscopic (attract water) and can clog the micropores of standard breathable membranes, leading to leaks or loss of breathability.
*   **Tyvek Specs**:
    *   Standard *Tyvek Housewrap* is generally durable but for direct coastal exposure (within 500m of sea), higher grades are safer.
    *   **Recommended Product**: **Tyvek Supro Plus** (includes integral tape for airtightness) or **Proctor Wraptite** (self-adhesive, fully airtight).
    *   **Key Spec**: Look for "Salt Spray Test" compliance (e.g., ASTM B117) or "Marine Grade". If not available, ensure the external cladding is a rainscreen with a clear air gap to act as the primary salt trap.

## 7. Action Plan
1.  **Roof**: Design a **Warm Roof** system. Check planning height restrictions (2.5m max eaves usually allowed, but check overall height).
2.  **Walls**: **Hybrid System**. 75mm PIR between studs + Continuous Foil VCL (taped) + 25mm service cavity batten + Internal Lining (OSB/Ply).
3.  **Floor**: **PIR**. 100mm PIR between floor joists (suspended) or on top of slab (floating). Tape joints.
4.  **Tools**: Budget for a **Desiccant Dehumidifier** (e.g., Meaco DD8L) – essential for coastal workshops.
