## High-Performance Insulation for Year-Round Workshop Use

This prompt focuses on "Phase Change" and "Vapour Control"—essential for a room that goes from cold (daytime) to warm (evening) quickly.

    Prompt for @librarian:
    "Research a 'High-Thermal-Inertia' insulation strategy for a 20m² workshop in Cowes, UK.

        Compare PIR Boards (100mm+) vs. Superior Multi-foil (e.g., SuperFOIL SF40) for evening use. Calculate the 'Warm-up Time' for each when using a 2kW heater in 5°C external temperatures.

        Document the 'Dew Point' risk for a coastal workshop. When I turn on the heat in the evening, where will the condensation form? Research the necessity of a continuous, taped Vapour Control Layer (VCL) on the warm side to protect cast-iron tool tables from 'flash rusting.'

        Research 'Cold Roof' vs. 'Warm Roof' construction for a 5-degree pitch. Which is less prone to interstitial condensation in the humid Isle of Wight climate?

## Planning & Permitted Development (PD)

Cowes has specific areas of Conservation and Article 4 Directions (where PD rights are removed). This prompt forces the agent to check the local Isle of Wight Council rules.

    Prompt for @librarian:
    "Conduct a legal audit for a 4x5m (20m²) detached outbuilding in Cowes, Isle of Wight.

        Verify Permitted Development (Class E) height limits: Confirm the 2.5m total height rule if within 2m of a boundary.

        Check the Isle of Wight Council Planning Portal for 'Article 4 Directions' in Cowes that might restrict outbuildings.

        Research the 'Incidental Use' clause: Does a 'Professional Woodworking Workshop' (potentially generating noise/dust) still qualify as 'incidental,' or does it risk being classified as 'Business Use' requiring Full Planning?

        Document Building Regulations Part L and Part P: Since the room is 20m², it is exempt from most Regs unless it’s within 1m of a boundary. Find the 'Non-combustible cladding' requirements (Part B) for buildings between 15m² and 30m² sited near a fence.
        Save to research/planning_and_regs.md."

## Acoustic & Environmental Impact (The "Good Neighbor" Research)

Since you’ll be working weekends and evenings, noise from a planer or table saw will be highly noticeable in a quiet residential area of Cowes.

    Prompt for @librarian:
    "Research noise mitigation strategies for a residential woodworking shop.

        Find the Rw (Weighted Sound Reduction Index) for a standard timber wall vs. one with Acoustic Mineral Wool (e.g., Rockwool RWA45) and double-layer 15mm Soundbloc plasterboard.

        Save to research/acoustic_strategy.md."

## Structural Rigidity & Vibration Damping

A standard garden room floor will "bounce" when a 200kg table saw or planer starts up. This ruins precision and creates noise.

    Prompt for @librarian:
    "Research industrial floor specifications for timber-frame workshops.

        Compare Double-Joisting (300mm centers) vs. Engineered I-Joists for a 4m span to eliminate deflection.

        Save to research/structural_vibration.md."

## Power & Electrical Load Management

Woodworking tools like thicknessers and dust extractors have high "startup surges" that can trip standard domestic breakers.

    Prompt for @librarian:
    "Conduct a deep dive into Workshop Electrical Systems (UK BS 7671 2026 standards).

        Research Motor Start-up Currents (Inrush Current) for 3HP induction motors and the necessity of Type C or Type D Breakers (MCBs) to prevent nuisance tripping.

        Save to research/electrical_and_machinery.md."

## Dust Extraction & Air Quality (COSHH Compliance)

In a 20m² space, fine dust (MDF/Hardwood) becomes a health and explosion risk within minutes without a proper "Local Exhaust Ventilation" (LEV) system.

    Prompt for @librarian:
    "Analyze dust management systems for small-scale workshops.

        Compare Single-Stage Bag Extractors vs. Two-Stage Cyclones. Find the CFM (Cubic Feet per Minute) requirements for a 100mm duct run over 5 meters.
