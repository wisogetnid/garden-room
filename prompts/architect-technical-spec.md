I need a high-fidelity, professional-grade Technical Specification for the 4x5m Cowes Workshop. Your previous output was too high-level; this version must be granular enough for a contractor to build from.

Develop a detailed Foundation and Groundworks Specification for the 4x5m workshop.

    Load Distribution: Based on the 2.5-ton estimated weight + heavy machinery, specify the Ground Screw torque requirements or Concrete Slab thickness (min 100mm with A193 mesh).

    The 'Splash' Zone: Detail the distance between the ground and the timber sole plate (min 150mm). Specify the Damp Proof Course (DPC) type and how it is lapped with the internal Damp Proof Membrane (DPM).

    Thermal Break: How will you insulate the floor to prevent 'cold-bridging' from the ground? Specify the PIR board compressive strength (e.g., 70kPa) required to sit under a workshop floor.

    Vermin Protection: Detail the stainless steel mesh specifications to prevent rodents from entering the sub-floor void.

Create a Layered Thermal Envelope Schedule. You must define every millimeter of the wall and roof section from the exterior cladding to the interior finish.

    The 'Sandwich': List every layer. Example: 19mm Larch -> 25mm Treated Batten -> Breather Membrane -> 12mm OSB3 -> 100mm PIR -> Vapour Control Layer -> 15mm OSB/Plasterboard.

    The Air Gap: Specify the 'Rain-screen' gap size (min 25mm) and the ventilation path from bottom to top to prevent salt-air moisture from rotting the batten.

    Sealing Strategy: Detail the Tape Specification (e.g., Tescon Vana) for the Vapour Control Layer. Every joint, socket box, and corner must be airtight.

    Detail the Corner Junctions and Window Reveals: How do we maintain the VCL (Vapour Control Layer) continuity at these weak points?

    U-Value Target: Calculate the estimated U-value for this build. If it is higher than 0.18 W/m²K, suggest a 'thin-profile' upgrade (like multi-foil) to improve it without losing internal floor space.

Design a Workshop Climate & Heating System optimized for evening/weekend use in a coastal environment.

    Heating Source: Compare Infrared (IR) Panels (for instant radiant heat on the user) vs. Low-Wattage Convection (for background frost protection) vs. wet and electric underfloor heating. Specify the total kW required for a 20m² space. Consider the wood workshop context

Mandatory Structural Rigidity & Vibration Logic:

    Read /research/structural_vibration.md. Do not just mention 'damping'; specify the exact joist centers (e.g., 300mm), the thickness of the sub-floor (e.g., 22mm P5 + 12mm Ply), and the specific placement of anti-vibration mats for the table saw and planer.

Format Requirements:

I am not looking for a summary. I am looking for a Standard Operating Procedure (SOP). For every item you mention, you must include: Material Name, Dimensions/Gauge, Fixing Method, and Purpose. If you cannot provide these, tell the @librarian to go back and find the missing data.
