(1) Research UK building regulations and planning permissions for garden rooms in Cowes, specifically for structures within 2m of a boundary, 2.5m height limits, and 20sqm use for non-habitable workshops.
(2) Compare the structural requirements and DIY complexity of flat slabs (using Jackodur Atlas) versus toe-thickened monolithic slabs for a 20sqm timber workshop.
(3) Investigate Jackodur Atlas slab insulation: technical specifications for UK loads, installation guides for DIYers, and island-specific availability or shipping logistics.
(4) Evaluate damp-proofing and thermal envelope strategies to protect woodworking tools from humidity and condensation in a UK coastal climate.
(5) Calculate excavation volumes and estimate manual labor hours for site clearing and hand-digging, specifically factoring in the narrow 'wheelbarrow-width' access for soil removal.
(6) Analyze concrete delivery logistics for restricted access: compare on-site manual mixing versus ready-mix with line-pumping or wheelbarrowing from the street.
(7) Research transport logistics for bulky materials (4m timbers, french doors, windows, and insulation packs) through narrow side passages.
(8) Identify local tool hire and waste management options in Cowes (e.g., skip placement, concrete breakers) that accommodate front-of-house storage and manual hauling.
(9) Develop a high-level foundation construction timeline, integrating manual labor rates, evening/weekend constraints, and the transport bottlenecks caused by limited access.
