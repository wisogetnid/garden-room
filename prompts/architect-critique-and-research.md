Conduct a Rigorous Technical Audit of the current plans/MASTER_PLAN.md. Act as a Lead Building Inspector and a Passivhaus Consultant.

Your Goal: Identify every 'thin' area where the plan lacks the detail required for a safe, high-performance 2026 workshop build in a coastal environment.

1. Structural Logic Audit:

    Critique the Foundation-to-Sill Plate junction. Does the plan specify the exact gauge of the anchor bolts and the compression-rated DPC (Damp Proof Course)?

    Review the Joist Span-to-Deflection ratio. If we are placing a 250kg cast-iron planer in the center of the 4m span, is 'standard spacing' enough? Find the 'dead-load' vs 'live-load' missing data.

2. Envelope & Moisture Integrity:

    Audit the Vapour Control Layer (VCL) strategy. How does the plan handle 'penetrations' (plumbing, electrical sockets, and dust ducting)? If it doesn't specify 'Airtightness Grommets' or 'Service Voids,' flag this as a critical failure point.

    Analyze the Salt-Air Corrosion Risk. Does the plan specify the grade of every external fastener? If it says 'Galvanized,' critique why it should be '316 Stainless Steel' for Cowes.

3. Workshop-Specific Safety:

    Critique the Dust Extraction Ducting. Does the plan account for static grounding in the pipes? If not, flag the fire/explosion risk.

    Review the Electrical Schedule. Is there a dedicated 'Kill Switch' or 'No-Volt Release' (NVR) strategy for the machinery?

4. Identification of 'Black Holes' (Research Gaps):

    Create a dedicated section: 'Required Librarian Deep-Dives'.

    List 5–10 specific technical data points we still lack (e.g., specific R-values of chosen materials, local IOW Council wind-load requirements, or specific decibel-drop ratings of the wall assembly).

Output Format:

    Start with a 'Critical Vulnerability' list (Red Flags).

    Follow with a 'Technical Recommendations' table.

    Conclude with the 'Research Request List' for the @librarian.
