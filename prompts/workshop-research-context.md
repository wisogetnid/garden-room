I'm building a 4m by 5m surfaced, 2.5m high garden room in Cowes, UK. 
The french patio door entry will face north, north-east, out onto an existing patio. Ideally, the garden room's floor is level with the outside patio.
The garden room borders neighbouring fences to the west and south.
I will use the garden room as a wood workshop with mostlly hand tools. 
Besides a requirement to keep the humidity below a certain point to protect the tools, I want to create an highly energy-efficient garden room, something akin to a passivehaus.  
I will build the garden-room mostly by myself, during evenings and weekends. This will also be my usage pattern once finished.
The access to the site behind our house passes by the side of our house, is only about a wheelbarrow wide and roughly 30m from the parking lot in front of our house.
In a later stage, I plan to add solar panels to the roof and a battery.
