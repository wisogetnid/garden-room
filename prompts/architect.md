Assemble the final Construction Roadmap for our 4x5m Cowes Woodworkshop.

Input Sources:

    Read all files in /research for technical specs on insulation, foundations, and coastal protection.

    Read thoughts/decisions.md (or your specific decision log) to understand the chosen trade-offs.

Your Task: Create a comprehensive plans/MASTER_PLAN.md that includes:
1. Structural Execution

    Specify the foundation type based on the clay soil research.

    Detail the floor joist spacing and vibration damping required for heavy machinery.

2. The 'Cowes-Proof' Envelope

    Define the exact wall 'sandwich' (Cladding -> Batten -> Breather Membrane -> OSB -> Insulation -> VCL -> Internal Finish).

    List the specific marine-grade fixings (316 Stainless) required for external longevity.

3. Workshop Infrastructure

    Power: Map out the electrical sub-main, including Type C breakers and IP66 socket placement.

    Dust: Outline the ducting paths for the cyclone extraction system based on our research.

    Moisture: Detail the placement of the desiccant dehumidifier and vapour control strategy.

4. Phased Build Schedule

    Create a step-by-step timeline (e.g., Week 1: Groundworks, Week 2: Framing).

Output Requirement: Save the plan and create a Pull Request with the title 'feat: final construction roadmap for review'.
