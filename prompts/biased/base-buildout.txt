I'm building a 4m by 5m surfaced, 2.5m high garden-room in Cowes, UK. 
Permitted development and planning permission have been validated already, don't research this area. 
I will use the garden room as a wood workshop with mostlly hand tools. 
Besides a requirement to keep the humidity below a certain point to protect the tools, 

In a later stage, I plan to add solar panels to the roof.
I want to create an highly energy-efficient garden room, something akin to a passivehaus.

I will build the garden-room mostly by myself, during evenings and weekends. 
The access to the site behind our house passes by the side of our house, is only about a wheelbarrow wide and roughly 30m from the parking lot in front of our house. 
I want to do the dig-out with hand-tools, no micro-digger.

For this research, focus on the foundation build. 
I want to have a concrete slab, using the jackodur atlas as ground insulation. 
I want to install 10mm parquet flooring inside and have the floor level with the ground outside.
I want to lay 16mm pipes for underfloor heating, one loop with 200mm spacing.

Attached is the Jackodur Atlas installation manual as well as the Atlas brochure. I'm looking to construct the wall in an ETICS style.

Focus on the dig-out and the different layers, create a work-plan, list all tools and consumables with a high-level price point.
