# **Technical Engineering and Implementation Analysis for a High-Efficiency Insulated Raft Foundation in Cowes**

This technical plan details the construction of a high-efficiency insulated raft foundation for a 4m x 5m wood workshop in Cowes, Isle of Wight. Utilizing the Jackodur Atlas system, this design provides a thermal-bridge-free envelope suitable for Passivhaus-standard performance, optimized for a manual, solo build with restricted site access.

## **1\. Geotechnical Context: Cowes Clay**

The site in Cowes is characterized by cohesive clay (Hamstead Member and Bembridge Marls), which is susceptible to seasonal volume changes.1 A raft foundation is appropriate as it "floats" on the soil, distributing loads evenly to minimize differential settlement in reactive clay. To ensure stability, the structure is decoupled from the clay via a non-frost-susceptible hardcore base, and a specialized drainage system is used to allow for a flush ground-level finish.

## **2\. Technical Specification and Build-Up (Flush Finish)**

This specification is designed for a flush ground-level finish to provide seamless access while maintaining a super-insulated envelope for humidity control.

| Layer | Thickness | Material/Technical Detail |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Concrete Slab** | 150mm | Reinforced C25/30 mix; serves as the thermal mass for the UFH system.3 |
| **Separation Layer (DPM)** | \<1mm | 1200-gauge DPM placed **over** the insulation to prevent grout loss and act as a moisture barrier. |
| **Main Insulation** | 150mm | Jackodur Atlas XPS ($R\_D \\approx 4.25 \\text{ m}^2\\text{K/W}$); eliminates thermal bridging. |
| **Blinding Layer** | 25mm | Sharp sand; provides a precision-leveled substrate for the insulation elements. |
| **Sub-Base** | 150mm | MOT Type 1; compacted in two 75mm layers for maximum stability. |
| **Total Build-Up** | **475mm** | Total vertical depth from Finished Floor Level (FFL) to the substrate. |

### **Weather-Proofing & Access Strategy**

* **Flush Finish:** The slab is set flush with the ground for aesthetics and access.  
* **Perimeter French Drain:** A 150mm-wide trench filled with 16/32mm clean filter gravel surrounds the structure to break the capillary bridge and direct surface water to the hardcore layer.  
* **Linear Threshold Drain:** An ACO linear drain is installed at the doorway to provide a solid bridge for heavy tools while intercepting water runoff.

## **3\. Logistical Engineering: The Manual Transit Challenge**

Moving materials 30m via a wheelbarrow-width path requires strict volume management.

### **Excavation Volume and Effort**

The Jackodur system requires a 40cm "over-dig" beyond the slab edge for the perimeter elements, creating a 4.8m x 5.8m footprint ($27.84 \\text{ m}^2$).5

* **Total Excavation Depth:** 475mm below natural ground level.  
* **Undisturbed Volume (Bank):** \~13.22 $\\text{m}^3$ of clay subsoil.  
* **Bulked Volume (Loose):** Clay expands by \~30% when disturbed. Total loose material: **\~17.2 $\\text{m}^3$**.6  
* **Transport Logistics:** Moving 17.2 $\\text{m}^3$ with an 85L barrow loaded to 50L (0.05 $\\text{m}^3$) requires approximately **344 round trips**.8  
* **Estimated Duration:** At a rate of 1 $\\text{m}^3$ per 5–8 hours in stiff clay, excavation will take **85 to 135 man-hours**.10

## **4\. Work-Plan: Phased Implementation**

### **Phase 1: Substrate Preparation & Drainage**

1. **Datum Setting:** Establish the FFL using a laser level, flush with the highest natural ground point.  
2. **Manual Dig-Out:** Excavate the area to 475mm depth. Create a 150mm shoulder for the gravel drain and a deeper pocket at the door for the linear drain bedding.  
3. **Hardcore:** Lay 150mm of MOT Type 1 in two 75mm lifts. Compact each lift thoroughly with a hired petrol wacker plate.  
4. **Blinding:** Apply 25mm of sharp sand. Level to a tolerance of $+/- 1$ cm over 5m to ensure the Jackodur boards fit without gaps.5

### **Phase 2: Insulation, Membrane & UFH**

1. **Jackodur Installation:** Assemble the 150mm Jackodur Atlas perimeter and area elements according to the custom plan.  
2. **DPM Separation Layer:** Install the 1200-gauge DPM **over** the top of the insulation boards. Lap the DPM up the inside of the vertical formwork upstands and secure it so it can eventually be joined to the wall's DPC.5  
3. **Reinforcement:** Place A393 steel mesh on 40/50mm grade plate spacers (wide bases prevent membrane punctures).12  
4. **UFH Piping:** Secure the 16mm pipe to the mesh at 200mm centers. Pressure test the 100m loop to 6 bar for 24 hours before the pour.14

### **Phase 3: Threshold & Concrete**

1. **Linear Drain:** Bed the threshold drain channel on 50mm of concrete at the doorway. Ensure the grate is 3-5mm below the slab level.  
2. **Line Pump Pour:** Pump 3.5 $\\text{m}^3$ of C25/30 concrete from the parking area via a 30m flexible hose.16  
3. **Finishing:** Level the concrete flush with the Jackodur formwork and the threshold drain edge.5  
4. **Perimeter Fill:** Once set, fill the remaining 150mm trench with 16/32mm clean filter gravel.
