# **Technical Engineering and Implementation Analysis for a High-Efficiency Insulated Raft Foundation in Cowes**

This plan details the construction of a 4m x 5m insulated raft foundation using the Jackodur Atlas system. This specification is optimized for a **flush ground-level finish** and features a **level-access threshold**, ensuring the workshop remains moisture-tight while providing a solid, direct entrance for moving woodworking tools and materials.

## **1\. Technical Specification and Build-Up (Flush Finish)**

| Layer | Thickness | Material/Technical Detail |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Concrete Slab** | 150mm | Reinforced C25/30 mix; flush with ground level.1 |
| **Main Insulation** | 150mm | Jackodur Atlas XPS ($R\_D \\approx 4.25 \\text{ m}^2\\text{K/W}$).3 |
| **Separation Layer** | \<1mm | 1200-gauge DPM; prevents grout loss and acts as a moisture barrier.3 |
| **Blinding Layer** | 25mm | Sharp sand; leveled to \+/- 1cm over 5m for insulation fit.3 |
| **Sub-Base** | 150mm | MOT Type 1; compacted in two 75mm layers.3 |
| **Total Build-Up** | **475mm** | Total vertical depth from FFL (Finished Floor Level) to substrate. |

### **Access Strategy: The Level Threshold Drain**

To provide direct access to the door without stepping on gravel, a **linear threshold drain** is installed directly in front of the door opening.

* **The Bridge:** The drain's metal grate serves as a solid bridge. You can walk or wheel heavy machinery across it.  
* **Load Class:** Use a **Load Class A15** (1.5 tonnes) grate for standard pedestrian access, or **B125** (12.5 tonnes) if you anticipate wheeling very heavy cast-iron machinery over the threshold.  
* **Integration:** The channel body sits on a 50mm concrete bed and connects directly to the perforated land-drain pipe in the perimeter gravel trench.

## **2\. Logistical Engineering: The "344 Barrow" Challenge**

Because the slab is flush with the ground, the entire 475mm build-up must be excavated below the natural grade.

### **Excavation Volume and Effort**

The Jackodur system requires a 40cm "over-dig" on all sides (4.8m x 5.8m footprint) to accommodate formwork elements.3

* **Total Excavation Depth:** 475mm below natural ground level.  
* **Undisturbed Volume (Bank):** \~13.22 m³ of clay subsoil.  
* **Bulked Volume (Loose):** Clay expands by \~30% when disturbed. The total loose volume is **\~17.2 m³**.11  
* **Transport Logistics:** Based on an 85L barrow loaded to 50L (0.05 m³), you will complete approximately **344 round trips** of 60 meters each (30m each way).12  
* **Estimated Duration:** Manual digging in Isle of Wight clay proceed at 1 m³ per 5–8 hours. Total excavation time: **85 to 135 man-hours**.14

## **3\. Work-Plan: Phased Implementation**

### **Phase 1: Substrate Preparation & Drainage**

1. **Setting Out:** Establish the FFL datum using a laser level, exactly flush with the surrounding ground.3  
2. **Excavation:** Dig the main area to 475mm deep. Create a 150mm-wide "shoulder" around the perimeter for the gravel drain, and a small deeper pocket (approx. 100mm) at the door location for the linear drain bedding.  
3. **Hardcore:** Lay 150mm of MOT Type 1 in two 75mm lifts, compacting each with a petrol wacker plate.3  
4. **Blinding:** Apply 25mm of sharp sand. Level to high precision to ensure the Jackodur boards fit tightly.3

### **Phase 2: Insulation, Membrane & UFH**

1. **Jackodur Installation:** Assemble the 150mm Jackodur Atlas elements.3  
2. **Waterproofing:** Lay the 1200-gauge DPM over the XPS. Lap the edges up over the perimeter formwork to eventually meet the wall's DPC.5  
3. **Steel & UFH:** Place A393 mesh on 40/50mm grade plate spacers.16 Secure the 16mm pipe at 200mm centers. Pressure test to 6 bar before the pour.3

### **Phase 3: Threshold & Concrete**

1. **Linear Drain Setup:** At the doorway, bed the linear drain channel on 50mm of concrete. Ensure the top of the grate is 3-5mm below your slab level to guarantee water flow into the drain.  
2. **Line Pump Hire:** Pump 3.5m³ of C25/30 concrete through the side-access.18  
3. **Finishing:** Level the concrete flush with the top of the Jackodur formwork and the edge of your linear drain.  
4. **Gravel Strip:** Once the concrete is set, fill the remaining perimeter trench with 16/32mm clean filter gravel up to ground level, except at the doorway where the linear drain provides access.
