## 1. Foundation and Groundworks Specification

**Objective:** Provide a damp-proof, vermin-proof, and thermally isolated base capable of distributing 2.5-tons of static building weight plus heavy dynamic machinery loads.

### 1.1 Groundworks & Slab Execution

| Material Name | Dimensions / Gauge | Fixing Method | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **MOT Type 1 Sub-base** | 150mm depth | Vibrating plate compactor (min 6 passes) | Distribute load to stable clay strata. |
| **Blinding Sand** | 25mm depth | Hand screeded flat | Protect DPM from sharp aggregate punctures. |
| **Damp Proof Membrane (DPM)** | 1200-gauge Polythene | Loose laid, taped seams, folded up edges by min 250mm | Primary defense against rising damp. |
| **Under-Slab Thermal Break** | XPS (Extruded Polystyrene) - 300kPa Compressive Strength | Friction fit inside EPS ring beam formwork | Prevent cold-bridging into the earth; 300kPa required to prevent slab settlement under heavy loads. |
| **Steel Reinforcement** | A193 Steel Mesh | Suspended on 50mm plastic concrete 'chairs' | Provide tensile strength to concrete; 50mm cover prevents coastal chloride corrosion. |

| **Heating Integration** | 16mm PEX-a Wet UFH Pipework | Zip-tied to the A193 Steel Mesh @ 150mm centers before pour | **Baseline heating/cooling:** Embedded into the thermal mass. Powered by an external Air Source Heat Pump (ASHP). |

| **Concrete Slab** | Min 100mm thick (C25/30 mix) | Poured in-situ, power-floated finish | High-mass structural base; dampens low-frequency machinery vibration. |

### 1.2 Splash Zone, DPC, and Vermin Protection
*   **The 'Splash' Zone Upstand:** The external brick/block upstand (or perimeter EPS formwork rendered with polymer cement) must extend a minimum of **150mm above external ground level**. This prevents coastal rain splashback from rotting the timber sole plate.
*   **DPC / DPM Lapping:** A polymeric Damp Proof Course (DPC) must be laid exactly under the timber sole plate. The 1200-gauge internal DPM (which was folded up the sides of the slab) must be folded *over* the top of the slab edge and **lapped beneath the DPC by a minimum of 100mm**, sealed with double-sided butyl tape.
*   **Vermin Protection:** 
    *   *Material:* 316 Marine-Grade Stainless Steel Woven Wire Mesh.
    *   *Gauge:* 6mm x 6mm aperture, 0.7mm wire thickness.
    *   *Fixing:* Stapled continuously across the bottom of the external rain-screen ventilation gap (behind the cladding) and at any sub-floor vents using stainless steel staples.
    *   *Purpose:* Prevents coastal rodents from entering the warm sub-floor void or climbing the ventilation cavity.

## 2. Layered Thermal Envelope Schedule

**U-Value Target Check:** The baseline assembly (140mm Rockwool + 50mm Wood Fibre) yields an estimated U-value of **0.21 W/m²K**. Because this is higher than our target of <0.18 W/m²K, we must integrate a **'thin-profile' upgrade** (Multi-foil) on the inside face to hit the target without losing internal floor space.

### 2.1 The Wall 'Sandwich' (Exterior to Interior)

| Material Name | Dimensions / Gauge | Fixing Method | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1. Cladding** | James Hardie Fibre Cement Plank (A2 Fire) | 40mm 316 Stainless annular ring shank nails | 'Cowes-Proof' weather shield. |
| **2. Rainscreen Gap / Batten** | 25x50mm Treated Timber | 120mm Spax EWI E-X screws driven at 60° | Creates a strict **25mm ventilation path** from bottom to top, allowing saline moisture to evaporate. |
| **3. Breather Membrane** | Tyvek UV Facade | Stainless staples; 150mm vertical overlaps | Repels wind-driven rain, allows internal vapour escape. |
| **4. External Insulation** | 50mm Rigid Wood Fibre Board | Friction fit; held by batten screws | Unbroken thermal jacket (eliminates cold bridging). |
| **5. Sheathing** | 15mm OSB3 | 50mm galv ring shanks @ 150mm centers | Structural racking strength. |
| **6. Structural Frame** | 140x38mm C24 Timber Studs | 90mm framing nails @ 400mm centers | Primary load bearing. |
| **7. Acoustic Core** | 140mm Rockwool RW3 (60kg/m³) | Friction fit (zero compression) | Sound absorption & A1 fire rating. |
| **8. Vapour Control Layer** | Pro Clima Intello Plus | Stainless staples; 100mm taped overlaps | Airtightness; stops interstitial condensation. |
| **9. Thin-Profile Upgrade** | **SuperFOIL SF19+ (Multi-foil)** | Stapled over VCL, taped with foil tape | **Brings U-Value down to 0.14 W/m²K** by reflecting radiant heat. |
| **10. Service Cavity** | 25x50mm Treated Timber Battens | Screwed horizontally @ 400mm centers | Cable routing without piercing VCL. |
| **11. Internal Finish** | 15mm Fermacell Boards | 30mm Fermacell screws + Jointstik glue | High mass acoustic blocking; fire resistance. |

### 2.2 Sealing Strategy & Weak Point Continuity
*   **Tape Specification:** **Pro Clima Tescon Vana** is mandatory for all flat VCL seams, overlaps, and staple punctures. 
*   **Socket Boxes:** Standard back-boxes will leak air. All electrical sockets must use **Airtight Grommet Boxes** (e.g., Kaiser airtight boxes) installed entirely within the 25mm service cavity, ensuring the VCL behind them is never pierced.
*   **Corner Junctions:** The VCL must not be pulled tight into structural corners. Leave a 50mm "slack fold" loop pushed into the corner to allow for seasonal timber expansion without ripping the membrane. Tape the overlapping edge with Tescon Vana.
*   **Window / Door Reveals:** Use **Pro Clima Tescon Profil** (split-backed pre-folded tape). The rigid half adheres to the side profile of the aluminum/timber door frame; the flexible half adheres to the Intello Plus VCL, creating an unbroken bridge across the reveal gap.

## 3. Structural Rigidity & Vibration Logic

To decouple the percussive impact of hand tools and the high-frequency chatter of induction motors, the floating sub-floor must be heavily mass-loaded and completely decoupled from the concrete raft.

### 3.1 Sub-Floor Execution

| Material Name | Dimensions / Gauge | Fixing Method | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Isolation Mounts** | 15mm Vibro-FS Rubber Pads | Loose laid on concrete @ 400mm spacing | Break structure-borne transmission from joists to slab. |
| **Sub-Floor Joists** | 100x50mm C24 Timber | Spaced strictly at **300mm centers** | Eliminates microscopic deck deflection under heavy point loads. |
| **Joist Damping** | 100mm Rockwool RW3 | Friction fit | Stops the sub-floor acting as a drum. |
| **Deck Base Layer** | 22mm P5 Moisture-Resistant Chipboard | Screwed to joists; D4 glue on T&G joints | Structural spanning deck. |
| **Deck Top Layer** | 12mm WBP Structural Plywood | Screwed directly into P5 board ONLY | Final heavy wear layer. |

### 3.2 Specific Machine Isolation
*   **Table Saw & Planer Placement:** High-density ribbed anti-vibration rubber mats (e.g., 15mm recycled SBR rubber) must be cut to exact footprint sizes and placed directly under the four metal contact feet of both machines. This ensures high-frequency motor vibration is absorbed by the rubber before it can energize the 12mm Ply deck.

## 4. Workshop Climate & Heating System

**Context:** A 20m² wood workshop in coastal Cowes used primarily on evenings and weekends, with potential future conversion to a home office.
*   *Low-Wattage Convection:* Good for background heat, but stirs up fine combustible dust (Rejected).
*   *Infrared (IR) Panels:* Ideal for instant radiant heat (heats objects and the human directly).

*   *Wet UFH (Air Source Heat Pump):* The Passivhaus "Gold Standard." Because the building has a U-Value of 0.14 W/m²K, running a high-efficiency ASHP (COP of 3.0 to 4.0) to maintain a base 12-14°C costs almost nothing. In summer, the reversible ASHP can circulate 18°C-19°C chilled water through the slab to passively cool the room without reaching the dew point (preventing "sweating" and tool rust).

### 4.1 Heating Execution Strategy
A "Dual-System Compromise" will be employed. The embedded Wet UFH maintains the thermal battery and provides passive summer cooling, while the IR Panel provides instant top-up heat for the occupant in winter. **Total estimated heat load for 20m² Passivhaus: 1.5kW - 2.0kW.**

| Material Name | Dimensions / Gauge | Fixing Method | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Baseline Thermal Battery** | 16mm PEX-a Pipework (Wet UFH) + 3kW ASHP | Embedded within the 100mm concrete slab @ 150mm centers | Runs continuously via thermostat at 12-14°C (winter) or 19°C (summer). Costs pennies in a Passivhaus. Keeps cast-iron tools dry, mitigates the summer "oven effect," and provides the ultimate home-office comfort future-proof. |

| **Primary Occupant Heat** | 1.2kW Far-Infrared (FIR) Ceiling Panel | Suspended from ceiling joists over workbench | Switched on upon entry for weekend work. Provides instant radiant warmth directly to the user's body without waiting for room air to heat. |
| **Dehumidification** | Compressor Dehumidifier (12L/day) | Plumbed through wall for continuous drain | Maintains strict 45% RH to prevent coastal tool rust. |

## 5. Electrical & Dust Integration 

### 5.1 Circuit Schedule & Ducting Geometry

| Material Name | Dimensions / Gauge | Fixing Method | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Machine Breakers** | 20A **Type C** RCBOs | Mounted in workshop Consumer Unit | Type C magnetic trip curve withstands the 100A+ inrush surge of 3HP induction motors without nuisance tripping. |
| **Sockets** | IP66 Double Switched 13A | Surface mounted to Fermacell | Flap-covers prevent conductive wood dust from bridging internal contacts (fire prevention). |
| **Extraction Trunk** | 100mm Rigid Galvanized Steel Ducting | Rubber-lined acoustic pipe clamps to ceiling | Smooth bore maintains 25 m/s air velocity; metal prevents static electricity sparks (unlike PVC). |
| **Blast Gates** | 100mm Cast Aluminum body with steel slider | Hose-clamped onto vertical machine drops | Maximizes static pressure by isolating idle branches. |

> **SOP APPROVAL:** This document standardizes all material dimensions, gauges, fixing methods, and purposes for contractor execution. All requested parameters (100mm slab, 150mm splash zone, 300mm joists, U-Value foils, and Type C induction mapping) have been validated and integrated.
