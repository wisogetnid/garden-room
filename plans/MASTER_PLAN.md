# MASTER PLAN: Cowes Passivhaus Woodworkshop (4x5m)

**Objective:** To construct a 20m² standalone woodworking shop in Cowes, UK. The structure must prioritize high acoustic isolation (for neighborhood peace), Passivhaus-level thermal efficiency (to minimize winter heating costs), and maintain a strict 45% relative humidity to protect cast-iron hand tools from coastal saline moisture.

## 1. Structural Execution

### Foundation Strategy: Insulated Concrete Raft (Floating)
Due to the "shrink-swell" mechanism of Cowes' active clay soils (active zone typically 0.75m to 1.0m deep), a standard shallow trench fill is risky and a concrete slab is heavy. We will utilize an **EPS Insulated Concrete Raft** (e.g., Legalett or Isoquick). 
* **The Excavation:** Dig down below the active organic layer to stable ground, filling with compacted MOT Type 1 hardcore. 
* **The Damp Proofing:** A layer of sand blinding followed by a continuous 1200-gauge polythene Damp Proof Membrane (DPM) lapped up the sides to connect with the wall DPC. 
* **The Concrete Pour:** The raft will be formed inside high-compressive-strength EPS insulation, eliminating ground-level thermal bridging. The steel mesh (grade B500A or B500B) must be suspended on "chairs" to ensure a minimum 50mm concrete cover to prevent coastal carbonation and corrosion.
* **Vibration Damping & Floor Joists:** By choosing a concrete raft over a suspended timber floor, we completely eliminate the need for structural floor joists. The immense mass of the concrete slab acts as the primary vibration dampener for heavy machinery (like a cabinet saw or planer-thicknesser). Machines will sit directly on the power-floated concrete surface, supplemented by 10mm-15mm dense anti-vibration rubber mats under the machine feet to decouple high-frequency chatter.

## 2. The "Cowes-Proof" Envelope

To achieve acoustic mass without sacrificing internal space to "Twin-Stud" framing, we have designed a single structural timber frame wrapped in continuous external insulation. 

### The Wall "Sandwich" (Outside to Inside)
1. **Cladding:** Fibre Cement (e.g., James Hardie) or Marine-Grade Composite (e.g., Millboard) to resist salt-spray rot and UV degradation.
2. **Thermally Broken Battens & Fixings:** 25mm vertical treated timber battens. Crucially, these must be secured using specialized EWI screws (e.g., Spax or Helifix) driven through the insulation into the studs behind. **All external fixings must be Grade 316 (A4) Stainless Steel**, containing 2-3% molybdenum to prevent chloride-induced pitting corrosion.
3. **Breather Membrane:** High-performance, UV-resistant membrane (e.g., Tyvek UV Facade), taped at all overlaps (100mm horizontal, 150mm vertical) to hold out wind-driven coastal rain while remaining vapour permeable.
4. **Continuous External Insulation:** 50mm rigid Wood Fibre board or XPS, providing an unbroken thermal jacket to eliminate cold bridges at the timber studs.
5. **Sheathing:** 15mm OSB3, functioning as the primary structural racking board. 
6. **Structural Frame & Acoustic Core:** 140x38mm timber studs at 400mm centers. The void is fully packed with **Acoustic Mineral Wool (Rockwool)** for maximum sound absorption and an A1 fire rating.
7. **Vapour Control Layer (VCL):** An intelligent membrane (e.g., Pro Clima Intello Plus), meticulously taped at every joint, staple, and corner with Tescon Vana tape. This is the absolute airtightness line.
8. **Service Cavity:** 25mm horizontal timber battens. This creates a shallow void to run electrical cables and mount sockets *without* ever piercing the VCL.
9. **Internal Finish:** 12.5mm or 15mm Fermacell "One-Man" acoustic boards (1200x600mm for safe solo lifting down the narrow path).

### The Roof Strategy
* A **"Warm Roof"** design to guarantee zero interstitial condensation. 
* Timber roof joists (sized to span the 4m width) topped with an 18mm OSB deck, followed by a continuous layer of high-compressive-strength PIR insulation (to support future solar PV point loads), finished with a seamless, 50-year EPDM rubber membrane. Internal ceiling height will be compromised slightly to stay strictly under the 2.5m Permitted Development limit.

### The Entryway
* Symmetrical French doors are rejected due to acoustic failure at the meeting stile. 
* **The Asymmetric "1.5" Door:** A 1000mm active timber/aluminum composite leaf coupled with a 400mm-500mm bolted slave leaf. Provides a Passivhaus-level seal for daily use, but opens to 1.4m+ to wheel in heavy machinery or 8x4 sheet goods.

## 3. Workshop Infrastructure

### Electrical Power
* **Sub-Main:** Armored SWA cable trenched from the main house to a dedicated sub-consumer unit inside the workshop.
* **Breakers:** **Type C RCBOs/Breakers** are mandatory for the machinery ring main to handle the massive inrush current (surge) of induction motors (table saws, bandsaws, dust extractors) without nuisance tripping.
* **Sockets:** All sockets must be **IP66 rated** (dust and moisture proof) to prevent fine airborne "dust flour" from entering the contacts and causing a fire hazard.

### Dust Extraction (Internal Recirculation)
* Venting dust outside destroys the Passivhaus airtightness and dumps all your expensive heat. Therefore, we will use an **Internal Recirculating HVLP System**.
* **The Cyclone:** An Oneida Dust Deputy (or equivalent cyclone pre-separator) is mandatory. It uses centrifugal force to spin out 99% of the wood waste before it hits the extractor, preventing the fine dust from blinding the expensive HEPA filters required for safe indoor recirculation.
* **Ducting Paths:** Rigid, smooth-bore galvanized metal ducting (or grounded anti-static PVC) running high along the walls/ceiling inside the service cavity or exposed, dropping down vertically to blast gates at each major machine to minimize static build-up and airflow friction.

### Moisture & Climate Control
* **Primary Heat & Base Ventilation:** The concrete slab will be slowly, continuously heated (via electric UFH or an oil-filled radiator) to act as a thermal battery, keeping the room at a constant 15°C to protect cast iron. A pair of decentralized MVHR units (e.g., Blauberg Vento) will provide continuous cross-ventilation and fresh air without losing the heat.
* **Active Dehumidification:** To guarantee the strict 45% Relative Humidity requirement (especially during humid Cowes winters), a standalone **Compressor Dehumidifier** will be installed with a permanent condensate drain plumbed through the wall. The latent heat generated by the compressor will contribute to the Passivhaus thermal loop.

## 4. Phased Build Schedule (Solo Weekend Warrior Timeline)

*Because this is a solo build utilizing an Insulated Concrete Raft, the schedule must include a strict curing halt to prevent moisture from the wet concrete rotting the newly sealed timber frame.*

* **Week 1: Groundworks.** Excavation of the active clay zone. Lay MOT Type 1 hardcore, sand blinding, 1200-gauge DPM, and assemble the EPS insulated raft formwork. Suspend steel B500A/B mesh on chairs.
* **Week 2: The Pour.** Concrete pumped or barrowed in (Hired help highly recommended for this day). Power float the finish for the heavy machinery.
* **Weeks 3 - 6: The Mandatory Curing Halt.** All construction stops for exactly 4 weeks to allow the concrete to release hundreds of liters of water into the atmosphere, ensuring a dry base for the timber.
* **Week 7: Sole Plates & Framing.** Apply liquid DPM/swelling mastics under the treated timber sole plates. Erect the 140x38mm timber wall frames and the roof joists. 
* **Week 8: The Warm Roof.** Install roof OSB deck, rigid PIR roof insulation, and glue down the EPDM rubber membrane to achieve immediate overhead weathertightness.
* **Week 9: The External Envelope.** Install wall OSB sheathing, continuous external wood fibre/XPS, Tyvek breather membrane, thermally broken A4 battens, and the Fibre Cement/Millboard cladding.
* **Week 10: The Door Install.** Fit the Asymmetric 1.5 Door. Meticulously apply Pro Clima tapes to seal the door frame directly to the future VCL line. 
* **Week 11: Internal Insulation & VCL.** Pack all stud voids tightly with Rockwool acoustic mineral wool. Staple the Pro Clima Intello Plus VCL across all walls and the ceiling. Spend exhaustive hours taping every single joint, staple, and corner to guarantee airtightness.
* **Week 12: Service Cavity & First Fix.** Install the 25mm horizontal battens over the VCL. Run all electrical wiring, sub-main connections, and ceiling dust extraction ducting paths *inside* this cavity. 
* **Week 13: Internal Boarding.** Haul and install the Fermacell "One-Man" acoustic boards. Tape and joint the seams (or skim coat).
* **Week 14: Second Fix & Commissioning.** Install Type C breakers, IP66 sockets, and lighting. Commission the dMVHR units and Dehumidifier. Bring in the heavy cast-iron machinery and calibrate the workshop.
