# **Technical Specification and Architectural Plan for a High-Performance 20m² Workshop in Cowes, Isle of Wight**

The development of a professional-grade timber workshop within the residential context of Cowes requires a meticulous synthesis of structural engineering, building physics, and regulatory compliance. This report provides an exhaustive technical framework for a 20-square-metre structure situated in the southern corner of a backyard.  
The design has been upgraded to utilize a **monolithic insulated concrete raft foundation**. This "Passive Slab" approach specifically addresses the reactive "shrink-swell" clay soils of the Isle of Wight, manages the heavy point loads of industrial woodworking machinery and solar battery storage, and optimizes the vertical cross-section to strictly adhere to the 2.5-metre height restriction imposed by the United Kingdom’s Permitted Development rights.

## **Regulatory Framework and Statutory Compliance**

The proposed workshop must navigate two distinct but overlapping regulatory landscapes: the Planning Portal’s Permitted Development (PD) rules and the Building Regulations 2010\.

### **Permitted Development and Planning Constraints**

Under Class E of the General Permitted Development Order (GPDO), outbuildings are considered permitted development, provided they are incidental to the enjoyment of the dwellinghouse.

* **Height Limit:** Because the structure is located within 2.0 metres of a boundary, the maximum overall height is strictly capped at **2.5 metres** from the highest point of the adjacent natural ground.  
* **The "Slab Advantage":** By integrating the floor insulation and structure into the foundation (rather than building a timber floor on top of a base), this design "buys back" approximately 150mm of vertical space, maximizing internal headroom for machinery operation.

### **Building Regulations and Fire Safety**

Since the workshop will be within 1.0 metre of the boundary, the boundary-facing walls (South and East) must be constructed of non-combustible materials to prevent fire spread.

* **Cladding:** Use fiber-cement weatherboard (Euroclass A2) or fire-retardant-treated timber (Euroclass B-s1, d0).  
* **Foundation:** The concrete raft acts as a non-combustible plinth, elevating the timber frame away from ground moisture and providing a stable, fire-safe anchor.

## **Geotechnical Analysis: Mastering Cowes Clay**

Cowes is underlain by Paleogene sediments, specifically heavy, reactive clays susceptible to "shrink-swell" behavior.

* **Risk:** Seasonal moisture changes cause this soil to heave in winter and crack in summer, potentially destabilizing shallow foundations and jamming doors.  
* **Solution:** The reinforced raft foundation distributes the building's load (including heavy machinery and batteries) across the entire 20m² footprint. This allows the structure to "float" on the clay, moving as a single rigid unit to prevent differential settlement.

## **Foundation Engineering: The Insulated "Passive Slab"**

Replacing the previously considered paving slab base, the **Insulated Raft** is the only engineering solution that satisfies both the structural load requirements (machinery/batteries) and the thermal efficiency goals.

### **Vertical Build-Up (Ground Up)**

To maintain the 2.5m height limit while ensuring a robust damp-proof floor, the build-up is as follows:

1. **Sub-Base:** 100mm of compacted MOT Type 1 hardcore on a prepared clay sub-grade.  
2. **Blinding:** 25mm sharp sand to protect membranes.  
3. **Damp Proofing:** 1200-gauge Damp Proof Membrane (DPM), lapped up the sides.  
4. **Insulation:** 100mm **EPS300** (Expanded Polystyrene). The "300" grade denotes a high compressive strength (300kPa) capable of supporting the concrete slab and heavy woodworking machinery without deformation.  
5. **Structural Slab:** 150mm Reinforced Concrete (C25/30 mix) with **A193 steel mesh** and polypropylene fibers. The mesh resists tensile forces from heavy point loads (e.g., Tesla Powerwall batteries), while fibers prevent micro-cracking.

### **Logistics: The Line Pump Strategy**

The "wheelbarrow-width" access in Cowes makes manual concrete transport unfeasible for a 3.5m³ pour (approx 50-60 loads).

* **Requirement:** Hire a **Concrete Line Pump**. This utilizes flexible 100mm hoses run through the side access, allowing the entire slab to be poured monolithically in under 45 minutes.  
* **Excavation:** Use a micro-digger (750mm wide) such as a Bobcat E10 to manage the \~5m³ of clay excavation.

## **Structural Design and Height Optimization**

The 2.5-metre height limit necessitates a high-precision vertical build-up. The concrete raft serves as the finished floor level (FFL), eliminating the need for timber floor joists.

### **Vertical Cross-Section Table**

| Component | Specification | Thickness (mm) | Cumulative Height (mm) |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Ground Level** | **Reference Point** | **0** | **0** |
| Foundation Projection | Slab Top Level (75mm above GL) | \+75 | 75 |
| **Internal Floor** | **Power-floated Concrete** | **0** | **75** |
| **Internal Headroom** | **Clear Workspace Height** | **2143** | **2218** |
| Roof Deck | 18mm OSB3 | 18 | 2236 |
| Rafters (Tapered) | C24 Timber (150mm tapering to 100mm) | 150 (at front) | 2386 |
| Insulation (Warm Roof) | 100mm PIR \+ Ply Cap | 110 | 2496 |
| Roof Finish | EPDM Membrane | 4 | **2500** |

*Note: This configuration achieves an internal ceiling height of over 2.1m, ideal for upright bandsaw operation and handling vertical timber boards.*

### **Framing and Anchoring**

* **Sole Plates:** Pressure-treated 47x100mm timber must be anchored to the concrete slab using **M12 masonry bolts** or concrete screws. A DPC strip must be placed between the timber and the concrete to prevent capillary moisture uptake.  
* **Battery Wall:** In the area supporting wall-mounted solar batteries, stud centers should be reduced to 300mm or double-studded to transfer the load effectively to the reinforced slab edge.

## **Building Envelope and Thermal Performance**

### **Insulation Strategy**

* **Floor:** The foundation itself is the thermal element. 100mm of EPS300 under the slab creates a "thermal battery," stabilizing the workshop temperature and preventing the "sweating slab" syndrome common in uninsulated outbuildings.  
* **Walls:** 100mm PIR boards (e.g., Celotex) fitted between studs.  
* **Roof:** A "warm roof" configuration with insulation above the deck to prevent condensation on structural timbers.

### **Moisture Control**

To protect cast-iron tools from the humid coastal air:

* **Vapour Control Layer (VCL):** A continuous 1000-gauge polythene sheet must be installed on the warm side of the wall insulation and taped directly to the floor DPM, creating a hermetically sealed bubble.

## **Mechanical and Electrical Systems**

### **Heavy Power Requirements**

The foundation is designed to support the specific loads of energy independence:

* **Solar Loads:** The roof framing must be anchored to the slab to resist wind uplift from Solent gales (Exposure Category D), utilizing the 7.2-tonne mass of the concrete base as a counterweight.  
* **Battery Storage:** The reinforced slab edge (thickened to 200mm at the perimeter) is specifically engineered to handle the point loads of stacked lithium battery units (\~228kg).

## **Revised Construction Plan**

### **Phase 1: Groundworks and Foundation (Days 1–5)**

1. **Excavation:** Dig out the 5.2m x 4.2m area to a depth of 200mm using a micro-digger.  
2. **Sub-Base:** Install 100mm of MOT Type 1 and compact with a heavy vibrating plate until it passes the "footprint test" (no indentation when walked on).  
3. **Formwork:** Construct timber shuttering to the exact dimensions. Level perfectly using a laser level.  
4. **Insulation/Steel:** Lay blinding sand, DPM, and EPS300 boards. Install A193 steel mesh on "chairs" (spacers) to sit in the bottom third of the slab.  
5. **The Pour:** Use a line pump to place 3.5m³ of C25/30 concrete. Screed immediately, then bull-float once the bleed water has evaporated.  
6. **Cure:** Cover with plastic sheeting for 7 days to ensure full strength gain before framing.

### **Phase 2: Framing and Shell (Days 8–15)**

1. **Sole Plates:** Fix treated timber plates to the cured slab (bolt down through DPC).  
2. **Wall Erection:** Raise pre-fabricated wall panels.  
3. **Roof Structure:** Install tapered rafters to create the 1:40 fall required for drainage.  
4. **Weatherproofing:** Install EPDM roof membrane and wrap walls in breather membrane.

### **Phase 3: Cladding and Fit-out (Days 16–25)**

1. **Cladding:** Install fire-rated cement board on boundary walls and timber cladding on the front.  
2. **Insulation:** Fit PIR boards tightly between studs.  
3. **Lining:** Apply VCL and internal OSB3 boarding (stronger than plasterboard for hanging tools).
