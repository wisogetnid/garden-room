# **Comprehensive Analysis of Insulated Raft Foundation Systems for Small-Scale Residential and DIY Construction in the United Kingdom**

## **The Evolution of Ground-Bearing Thermal Envelopes and the Paradigm Shift in Foundation Engineering**

The transition toward high-performance building envelopes in the United Kingdom has necessitated a fundamental reappraisal of foundation design. Traditionally, foundations were regarded as purely structural sub-structures, designed to transfer the dead and live loads of a building to the underlying soil while ignoring the thermal implications of the ground-to-wall interface.1 However, the rise of the Passivhaus standard and the tightening of Approved Document L of the Building Regulations have moved the focus toward the "thermal envelope," which must be continuous to prevent energy loss and structural degradation through moisture ingress.2 In this context, the insulated raft foundation—a system where the concrete slab is entirely encased in a layer of high-performance insulation—has emerged as the gold standard for energy-efficient construction.4  
For the self-builder or solo DIY enthusiast, particularly those engaged in small-scale projects such as a 20m² garden room ($4\\text{m} \\times 5\\text{m}$), the selection of a foundation system is governed by a complex intersection of structural capacity, thermal performance, and logistical feasibility.6 The Jackodur Atlas system has long served as a benchmark in this sector, utilizing Extruded Polystyrene (XPS) to provide both formwork and insulation in a unified "click-system".8 Nevertheless, for builders in the United Kingdom, the desire for locally manufactured alternatives often stems from the need to minimize delivery costs, reduce the embodied carbon associated with long-distance shipping, and ensure that the system is optimized for the specific soil conditions and material availability found in the British Isles.2  
The following analysis provides an exhaustive technical evaluation of the insulated raft foundation market in the UK, comparing the Jackodur Atlas system against domestic competitors like Build-Lite Future Found, GreenRaft, and Advanced Foundation Systems, while specifically addressing the challenges of solo DIY installation on sites with restricted access.

## **Technical Foundations of the Jackodur Atlas System**

To evaluate competitors effectively, one must first establish the technical baseline provided by the Jackodur Atlas system. Manufactured from high-density XPS, the system is designed to eliminate thermal bridges at the floor-to-wall junction by wrapping the entire slab in a continuous thermal layer.12

### **Material Science and Extruded Polystyrene (XPS) Performance**

The Jackodur Atlas system utilizes XPS, which is manufactured through an extrusion process where polystyrene beads are melted and injected with a blowing agent under high pressure.12 This creates a closed-cell structure characterized by a uniform skin and the absence of voids, leading to several critical performance metrics for ground-contact applications.12

| Parameter | Specification |
| :---- | :---- |
| **Material Type** | Extruded Polystyrene (XPS) according to EN 13164 14 |
| **Thermal Conductivity ($\\lambda\_D$)** | $0.027\\text{ W/m}\\cdot\\text{K}$ (Plus 300\) to $0.038\\text{ W/m}\\cdot\\text{K}$ 12 |
| **Compressive Stress (10% deformation)** | $300\\text{ kPa}, 500\\text{ kPa}, 700\\text{ kPa}$ 8 |
| **Long-term Compressive Creep (50 years)** | $130\\text{ kPa}$ (Atlas 300\) to $250\\text{ kPa}$ (Atlas 700\) 8 |
| **Water Absorption** | Resistant to groundwater, frost, and thaw changes 14 |

The system's modularity is achieved through a variety of pre-cut components, including corner elements, side elements, and surface boards, which are often provided as a bespoke package tailored to the specific floor plan of the project.8 This pre-cutting reduces the need for on-site tools and minimizes waste, although it necessitates high accuracy during the initial ground preparation phase.8

### **Structural and Thermal Integration**

The integration of the formwork (shuttering) with the insulation is a central advantage of the Jackodur system. The "L-shaped" or rectangular formwork elements create a permanent mold for the concrete, allowing the insulation to remain in place after the pour to provide a continuous thermal break.12 This system is suitable for various superstructure types, including timber frame and Insulated Concrete Formwork (ICF), provided the applied stress does not exceed $83\\text{ kPa}$ at the serviceability limit state.12

## **UK-Based Competitors: The Market for Domestically Manufactured Systems**

The UK market has responded to the demand for insulated foundations with several indigenous systems that offer comparable or superior performance, often with greater logistical flexibility for small-scale DIY projects.2

### **Build-Lite Future Found (South Yorkshire)**

Based in South Yorkshire, Build-Lite manufactures the Future Found system, which is arguably the most direct UK-based competitor to the Jackodur Atlas system.2 Future Found is a high-performance insulated raft foundation system designed to eliminate cold bridging and streamline the construction process, particularly on sites where traditional footings might be problematic.2

#### **Efficiency and Logistics for DIYers**

A major advantage of the Future Found system is its focus on reducing material consumption. The design can lead to a $40\\%$ reduction in concrete usage compared to traditional strip foundations, which is a critical consideration for a solo builder with limited site access.2 Reducing the volume of concrete not only lowers the material cost but also drastically reduces the labor required for wheelbarrowing or the cost of hiring specialized pumping equipment.2

| Feature | Future Found System |
| :---- | :---- |
| **Manufacturer Location** | South Yorkshire, UK 2 |
| **Insulation Material** | High-performance Expanded Polystyrene (EPS) 2 |
| **U-Value Capability** | As low as $0.08\\text{ W/m}^2\\cdot\\text{K}$ 2 |
| **Psi-Value Capability** | As low as $0.06\\text{ W/m}\\cdot\\text{K}$ 2 |
| **Machinery Reduction** | Up to $50\\%$ reduction in plant requirements 2 |

The system is BBA certified and compatible with various building systems, including Structural Insulated Panels (SIPs), which are commonly used in garden rooms.2 The ability to reach finished floor level in a single pour further accelerates the timeline for the solo builder.2

### **GreenRaft (Devon)**

GreenRaft, based in Exeter, offers a system that distinguishes itself from both Jackodur and Future Found through its philosophy of "on-site accuracy".10 While many systems rely on pre-manufactured, moulded components that must match a factory drawing exactly, GreenRaft utilizes a handful of basic, high-density XPS components that are configured and cut on-site.10

#### **Suitability for Sites with Restricted Access**

For a 20m² garden room, site access through a garden gate is a significant constraint. GreenRaft’s components are designed to be lightweight and manageable by a single person, and because the system is not entirely pre-cut to a rigid plan, it allows for minor on-site adjustments.10 This is particularly useful for DIYers who may find that their excavation is not perfectly square or that underground obstacles necessitate a slight shift in the building's footprint.10  
The system uses high-density XPS for the load-bearing base layer and rigid XPS edge insulation to create the thermal envelope.11 It is capable of supporting significant loads, including those from brick or stone veneers, and can be customized with upstands for timber frame or SIPs construction to raise the wall plate $150\\text{ mm}$ above ground level, adhering to warranty requirements.11 GreenRaft claims its system is approximately $20\\%$ less expensive than pre-manufactured competitors, largely due to the reduction in off-site manufacturing overheads.10

### **Advanced Foundation Systems: THEPASSIVHAUS (Devon)**

Advanced Foundation Systems, also headquartered in Devon, manufactures the THEPASSIVHAUS foundation system.3 This system has been recognized by the Passivhaus Institute in Darmstadt as "the most complete" system they have assessed.3

#### **Technical Innovations for Self-Builders**

The THEPASSIVHAUS system uses factory-cut, insulating permanent formwork and is engineered to handle high loads, sometimes without the need for traditional steel mesh reinforcement, depending on the specific design.3 For the solo DIYer, eliminating the need to cut and tie steel rebar can save significant time and physical effort.3 The system is "made in Devon" and is geared toward both self-builds and commercial projects, offering a bespoke engineering service that ensures the foundation is tailored to the specific soil types of the UK.3

| Property | THEPASSIVHAUS Foundation |
| :---- | :---- |
| **Certification** | Passivhaus certified 3 |
| **Manufacturing** | Kingsbridge, Devon, UK 3 |
| **Core Advantage** | High load capacity, often without steel reinforcement 3 |
| **Service Model** | Design, manufacture, and installation available 3 |

The system's adaptability extends to difficult ground conditions, allowing for the use of insulated rafts where traditional footings might fail or be prohibitively expensive.3

## **Component-Based Alternatives and the "Assemble Your Own" Approach**

For the DIYer looking for maximum cost savings, it is possible to bypass branded "kits" and source high-performance insulation boards directly from UK manufacturers to create a custom insulated raft.

### **Jablite: The UK's Largest EPS Producer**

Jablite is the leading UK manufacturer of Expanded Polystyrene (EPS) products, with three manufacturing sites located in Aberdeen, Howden, and Ford.17 Their Jabfloor EPS70 and high-density variants provide a robust foundation for residential slabs.18  
While EPS has a slightly higher thermal conductivity ($\\lambda \\approx 0.038\\text{ W/m}\\cdot\\text{K}$) than some XPS products, it is significantly more cost-effective and is fully recyclable.18 For a 20m² garden room, EPS 100 or EPS 200 boards provide more than enough compressive strength ($100\\text{ kPa}$ to $200\\text{ kPa}$ at $10\\%$ deformation) to support the structure.5 Jablite products are BBA certified and can be used below a ground-supported slab or within a beam-and-block system.18

### **Sundolitt: High-Performance XPS and EPS**

Sundolitt operates three UK manufacturing plants in Fort William, Montrose, and Gateshead.20 They are recognized leaders in the supply of both EPS and XPS for civil engineering and construction.21 Their Sundolitt XPS 300 is a direct material competitor to the Jackodur Atlas boards, offering $300\\text{ kPa}$ compressive strength and exceptional moisture resistance.21

| Product | Thermal Conductivity (λ) | Compressive Strength | UK Manufacture |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Sundolitt XPS 300** | $0.033\\text{ W/m}\\cdot\\text{K}$ 21 | $300\\text{ kPa}$ 21 | Supplied in UK 20 |
| **Sundolitt EPS 100** | $0.036\\text{ W/m}\\cdot\\text{K}$ 23 | $100\\text{ kPa}$ 23 | Yes (Gateshead/Scotland) 20 |
| **Jablite Jabfloor 70** | $0.038\\text{ W/m}\\cdot\\text{K}$ 18 | $70\\text{ kPa}$ 18 | Yes (Ford/Howden/Aberdeen) 17 |

Using these components, a DIYer can construct their own shuttering from timber and line it with these high-performance boards, potentially reducing the material cost by $30-50\\%$ compared to a branded kit.24

## **The Physics of Ground-Contact Insulation: XPS vs. EPS**

Understanding the difference between XPS and EPS is crucial for selecting the right foundation material, particularly in the damp UK climate.

### **Moisture Dynamics and Thermal Conductivity**

Extruded Polystyrene (XPS) is manufactured to have a completely closed-cell structure, which makes it virtually impervious to water absorption.12 In contrast, Expanded Polystyrene (EPS) consists of fused beads; while the beads themselves are closed-cell, the interstitial spaces between them can allow for limited water absorption over long periods if submerged.18  
For a garden room, if the site has a high water table or is prone to flooding, XPS is the safer choice.14 If the ground is well-drained, high-density EPS (EPS 100 or above) is a technically sound and more economical alternative.5

### **Structural Calculations for the Solo DIYer**

For a $4\\text{m} \\times 5\\text{m}$ slab, the weight of the concrete alone is a primary consideration. A $150\\text{ mm}$ thick slab over $20\\text{ m}^2$ requires $3\\text{ m}^3$ of concrete.  
The density of wet concrete is approximately $2,400\\text{ kg/m}^3$.  
Total concrete weight: $3\\text{ m}^3 \\times 2,400\\text{ kg/m}^3 \= 7,200\\text{ kg}$.  
This load is spread over $20\\text{ m}^2$, resulting in a dead load of:  
$\\frac{7,200\\text{ kg} \\times 9.81\\text{ m/s}^2}{20\\text{ m}^2} \\approx 3.53\\text{ kPa}$.  
Even with the addition of a heavy timber frame and snow loads, the total pressure on the insulation is unlikely to exceed $10\\text{ kPa} \- 15\\text{ kPa}$. Considering that the lowest grade of insulation discussed (EPS 70\) can withstand $70\\text{ kPa}$ at $10\\%$ deformation, the structural factor of safety for a garden room is remarkably high.2

## **Logistical Optimization: Managing Limited Site Access**

The "solo DIYer" persona introduces unique constraints, particularly when access is limited to a garden gate. The following strategies are essential for navigating these limitations.

### **Material Handling and Modular Delivery**

Insulation products are inherently lightweight. An EPS or XPS board of $2,400\\text{ mm} \\times 1,200\\text{ mm}$ typically weighs less than $10\\text{ kg}$, making it easy for one person to transport from the roadside to the back garden.18 This is a significant advantage over traditional materials like trench-fill concrete or heavy aggregate blocks.

### **The Concrete Challenge: Pumping vs. Wheelbarrowing**

The $3\\text{ m}^3$ of concrete required is the most significant logistical hurdle. A standard wheelbarrow holds approximately $0.05\\text{ m}^3$ to $0.07\\text{ m}^3$ of concrete.

* **Total Loads:** A solo builder would need to make $45 \- 60$ wheelbarrow trips from the concrete truck to the site.6  
* **Time Constraints:** Most concrete deliveries allow $30 \- 45$ minutes for offloading before charging "waiting time" fees. At one trip per minute, a solo builder is at the extreme limit of physical capability.6

**Recommendation:** For restricted access, a "line pump" is the optimal solution. These pumps can snake a pipe through a standard gate and even through the interior of a house if necessary. This allows the $3\\text{ m}^3$ to be poured and leveled in under 30 minutes, preserving the builder's energy for the critical task of screeding and finishing the surface.6

## **Step-by-Step Solo DIY Implementation Guide**

For the $4\\text{m} \\times 5\\text{m}$ garden room, the following workflow is recommended to ensure a high-quality insulated raft foundation.

### **Phase 1: Ground Preparation and Sub-Base**

1. **Excavation:** Dig out the footprint to a depth of $300\\text{ mm} \- 400\\text{ mm}$, allowing $300\\text{ mm}$ of extra width on all sides for the insulation formwork.7  
2. **Hardcore:** Lay $150\\text{ mm}$ of Type 1 MOT (granular sub-base) and compact it using a vibrating plate compactor. This layer is essential for preventing the slab from settling.7  
3. **Blinding:** Apply a $25\\text{ mm} \- 50\\text{ mm}$ layer of sharp sand or "blinding" over the hardcore to provide a perfectly level surface and to prevent the hardcore from puncturing the Damp Proof Membrane (DPM).6

### **Phase 2: The Thermal Envelope and Formwork**

1. **Damp Proof Membrane:** Lay a $1,200$-gauge DPM over the sand, ensuring it turns up at the edges to create a waterproof tub.6  
2. **Insulation Layout:** If using a kit like **GreenRaft** or **Jackodur**, place the corner and side elements first. If building a custom raft, use $100\\text{ mm}$ or $150\\text{ mm}$ XPS or EPS boards for the base and create vertical shuttering around the perimeter using the same material.8  
3. **Taping and Sealing:** Use specialized tape to seal all joints in the DPM and use low-expansion PU foam to seal any gaps in the insulation boards. This prevents "thermal bypass" and ensures the concrete does not leak during the pour.9

### **Phase 3: Reinforcement and Services**

1. **Spacers and Mesh:** Place plastic "chairs" or spacers on the insulation and lay the steel reinforcement mesh (e.g., A193).6 Ensure the mesh is $50\\text{ mm}$ from the edges and top surface of the concrete.28  
2. **Fiber Reinforcement Alternative:** Many modern DIYers opt for "fiber-reinforced concrete," where polypropylene or steel fibers are added to the mix at the batching plant. This eliminates the need for manual mesh handling and is ideal for sites with difficult access.7

### **Phase 4: The Concrete Pour**

1. **Screed Rails:** Set up temporary or permanent screed rails to act as a level guide.6  
2. **Pouring:** Whether using a pump or wheelbarrows, start from the furthest point and work toward the exit.6  
3. **Finishing:** Use a "daisy float" or power float to achieve a smooth finish, which is particularly important if the final floor covering is to be laid directly onto the concrete without a timber sub-floor.6

## **Sustainability and Long-Term Performance of UK Systems**

The selection of an insulated raft has significant implications for the building's lifecycle carbon footprint and operational energy use.

### **Embodied Carbon and Circularity**

Systems like **Jablite** and **Sundolitt** emphasize the circularity of EPS. Polystyrene is $100\\%$ recyclable and chemically inert, meaning it does not degrade over the life of the building.17 Furthermore, by choosing a UK-manufactured system, the transport-related carbon emissions are significantly reduced compared to importing systems from continental Europe.17

### **Thermal Mass and Comfort**

By placing the insulation *under* the concrete slab, the thermal mass of the concrete is brought inside the building's thermal envelope.28 This creates a "thermal flywheel" effect: the concrete absorbs heat during the day and slowly releases it at night, maintaining a stable temperature.5 This is especially beneficial for garden offices that may be heated intermittently.28

| Benefit | Impact on Garden Room |
| :---- | :---- |
| **No Timber Frame** | Increases internal headroom by approx. $150\\text{ mm}$, helping with $2.5\\text{ m}$ height restrictions.6 |
| **Moisture Barrier** | Concrete and DPM act together to prevent rising damp and rot.7 |
| **Underfloor Heating** | The insulation makes underfloor heating more efficient by preventing heat loss to the ground.2 |

## **Financial Analysis: Cost Savings and ROI for the DIYer**

A 20m² garden room foundation can be a significant portion of the total build budget. Choosing a DIY-friendly UK system can yield substantial savings.

### **Comparative Cost Estimates (20m² Project)**

| Expense Category | Professional Installation | DIY (Branded Kit) | DIY (Component-Based) |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Groundworks/Skips** | £2,000 | £1,000 | £1,000 |
| **Insulation/Formwork** | £3,000 | £2,500 | £1,200 |
| **Concrete & Delivery** | £1,500 | £1,000 | £1,000 |
| **Labor/Plant Hire** | £4,000 | £800 | £500 |
| **Total Cost** | **£10,500** | **£5,300** | **£3,700** |

Note: Estimates are based on standard UK market rates for materials and skips.24  
The DIY approach can effectively halve the cost of the foundation. Systems like **GreenRaft** and **Build-Lite Future Found** offer a middle ground: providing the engineering assurance of a professional system while remaining simple enough for a solo builder to install, thus avoiding the high labor costs associated with specialist groundworks teams.2

## **Alternative: The No-Concrete Solution for Extremely Restricted Access**

If the logistics of $3\\text{ m}^3$ of wet concrete are insurmountable for a solo builder with a narrow gate, the **Swift Foundation Raft** (manufactured in the UK) provides a unique alternative.33

### **Mechanism of the Swift Raft**

Instead of a concrete slab, the Swift system uses modular concrete plinths and a pre-cut timber or steel raft system.33 Each plinth is height-adjustable, allowing for the foundation to be leveled on uneven ground without massive excavation.33 While this does not provide the same thermal mass as a concrete slab, it can be fully insulated with PIR or EPS boards between the joists, achieving high thermal performance with zero "wet trade" on site.33

| Feature | Swift Foundation Raft |
| :---- | :---- |
| **Installation Time** | 1 day (compared to 4-7 days for concrete) 33 |
| **Site Disturbance** | Minimal (no digging required in many cases) 33 |
| **Solo Friendly** | Very High (no heavy machinery needed) 33 |
| **Bespoke Options** | Available for any building size 33 |

## **Conclusion: Tailoring the Selection to Site Realities**

The analysis confirms that the UK market offers robust, high-performance alternatives to the Jackodur Atlas system, many of which are specifically optimized for the constraints of a solo DIY builder.

### **Summary of Recommendations**

For the 4m by 5m garden room project, the optimal choice depends on the specific site access and the builder's appetite for concrete work:

1. **For Maximum Structural and Thermal Performance (The "Jackodur" Experience in the UK):** **Build-Lite Future Found** is the recommended choice. Its UK manufacturing base in South Yorkshire ensures lower delivery hurdles, while its $40\\%$ reduction in concrete volume directly addresses the "solo builder" labor constraint.2  
2. **For Financial Efficiency and Site Flexibility:** **GreenRaft** offers the best value. By using standard components that can be adjusted on-site, it mitigates the risk of a pre-cut kit not fitting an imperfectly dug hole, while its $20\\%$ lower cost makes it highly competitive.10  
3. **For Component-Level Sourcing:** Sourcing **Sundolitt XPS 300** or **Jablite Jabfloor** boards provides the highest level of cost control. This approach is best for the experienced DIYer who is comfortable building their own timber shuttering and calculating their own thermal requirements.17  
4. **For the Most Restricted Access (No-Concrete Path):** The **Swift Foundation Raft** allows for a professional, level, and durable base to be built by one person in a single day without the logistical nightmare of a concrete delivery through a narrow gate.33

Ultimately, the shift toward UK-manufactured insulated rafts represents a maturation of the self-build sector, providing domestic solutions that do not compromise on the stringent energy requirements of the 21st century while remaining accessible to the individual homeowner. By wrapping the foundation in a continuous layer of high-performance insulation, the builder ensures that the garden room is not just a seasonal shelter, but a high-value, energy-efficient extension of the home’s living space.
