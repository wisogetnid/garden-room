# Glazing & Automation Strategy: High Performance

**Context:**
- **Goal:** Maximise natural light, minimise heat loss/gain.
- **Orientation:** South-facing (Solar gain risk).
- **Environment:** Workshop (Dust).

## 1. Vacuum Insulated Glazing (VIG) vs. Triple Glazing

**Vacuum Insulated Glazing (e.g., LandVac, Pilkington Spacia):**
*   **Technology:** Two panes separated by 0.1mm vacuum gap with micro-spacers.
*   **Performance:**
    *   **U-Value:** **0.4 - 0.5 W/m²K** (Centre pane).
    *   **Thickness:** **8.3mm** (Thinner than single glazing!).
    *   **Weight:** ~20kg/m².
*   **Pros:** Incredible insulation in a slim profile. Retrofits into standard frames.
*   **Cons:** **Extreme Cost** (£400+/m²). Visible micro-dots.
*   **Verdict:** **Niche**. Best for heritage windows, not cost-effective for a new build garden room.

**Triple Glazing (e.g., Planitherm One):**
*   **Technology:** 3 panes, 2 cavities (Argon/Krypton fill), Low-E coatings.
*   **Performance:**
    *   **U-Value:** **0.6 - 0.8 W/m²K** (Whole window Uw ~0.8-0.9).
    *   **Thickness:** **44mm** (4-16-4-16-4).
    *   **Weight:** **30-40kg/m²**.
*   **Pros:** Excellent thermal & acoustic performance. Standard industry availability.
*   **Cons:** Heavy. Reduces light transmission slightly (Light Transmittance ~70%).
*   **Verdict:** **Winner**. The standard for high-performance builds.

## 2. Solar Control Strategy (South Facing)

**The Physics:**
A south-facing workshop acts as a greenhouse.
*   **Standard Glass (g-value ~0.7):** Admits 70% of solar heat. Great in winter, lethal in summer.
*   **Solar Control Glass (e.g., SKN 176):**
    *   **g-value:** **0.37** (Blocks 63% of solar heat).
    *   **Light Transmittance:** **70%** (Still bright).
    *   **U-Value:** **1.0 W/m²K** (Double Glazed unit).
*   **Trade-off:** You lose free winter heating.
*   **Recommendation:** **Avoid Solar Control Glass** if possible. Instead, use **Structural Shading** (Roof Overhang / Brise Soleil) designed to block high summer sun (June ~60° altitude) but admit low winter sun (Dec ~15° altitude). This is passive intelligence.

## 3. Automation: Matter & Thread (2026 Standard)

**Blind Control:**
In a dusty workshop, internal blinds get dirty.
*   **Solution A: Integrated Blinds (Between Glass):** Sealed unit. Dust free. Expensive. Often manual or proprietary motorized.
*   **Solution B: Smart Roller Blinds (Internal):**
    *   **Technology:** **Thread** (Networking protocol) + **Matter** (Smart Home Standard).
    *   **Product:** **Eve MotionBlinds** (Coulisse motors).
        *   **Connectivity:** Connects directly to Apple Home/Google Home via Thread Border Router (HomePod Mini / Nest Hub). No proprietary bridge required.
        *   **Power:** USB-C Rechargeable battery (lasts 6-12 months).
        *   **Features:** "Adaptive Shading" - closes automatically based on sun position/temp.
*   **Recommendation:** **Eve MotionBlinds Upgrade Kit** for standard roller blinds. Cost-effective, reliable, future-proof.

**Confidence Rating:** 5/5 (Glass Tech & Smart Home Protocols).
