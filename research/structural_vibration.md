# Structural Vibration Strategy: Heavy Machinery Workshop

**Context:**
- **Load:** Heavy Cast Iron Machinery (Table Saw ~250kg, Planer ~350kg, Lathe ~200kg + dynamic load).
- **Span:** 4m clear span.
- **Goal:** Minimal deflection (<L/500), rock-solid stability.

## 1. Floor Joist Comparison (4m Span)

Standard domestic floors (1.5 kN/m²) are inadequate for precision machinery. We target **5.0 kN/m²** (Light Industrial).

### A. Solid Timber (C24 Grade)
*   **Standard:** 47x150mm @ 400mm centers.
    *   *Result:* **FAIL**. Significant bounce. Deflection >15mm.
*   **Upgraded:** 47x220mm @ 400mm centers.
    *   *Result:* **PASS**. Deflection ~8mm. Good stiffness. Heavy to install.
*   **"Double Joisting":** 2x (47x150mm) bolted together @ 300mm centers.
    *   *Result:* **PASS**. Very stiff. Good damping.
    *   *Pros:* Easy to handle smaller timbers. Excellent screw retention for flooring.
    *   *Cons:* Uses more wood volume than deep I-joists.

### B. Engineered I-Joists (240mm Depth)
*   **Construction:** Timber flanges with OSB web.
*   **Performance:** extremely stiff for the weight. Can span 5-6m easily.
*   **Issue:** The thin OSB web transmits high-frequency vibration more readily than solid timber (drum effect). Point loads (machine feet) must be directly over blocking or reinforced sections.
*   **Verdict:** **Solid Timber (47x195mm or 47x220mm)** is preferred for *damping* vibration in workshops, even if I-joists are theoretically stronger stiffness-to-weight.

## 2. The "Torsion Box" Concept (Ultimate Stiffness)

To eliminate floor flex without massive steel beams:
1.  **Bottom Skin:** Glue and screw **12mm OSB** to the *underside* of the joists (before insulation).
2.  **Core:** The joists (47x195mm @ 400mm).
3.  **Top Skin:** Glue and screw **22mm P5 Chipboard** (or 18mm OSB) to the top.
4.  **Result:** This creates a **Structural Insulated Panel (SIP)** or Torsion Box. The floor acts as a single 240mm deep beam rather than individual joists.
    *   *Stiffness Increase:* ~200-300% stiffer than unskinned joists.
    *   *Bonus:* Creates a sealed, rodent-proof, airtight insulated floor cassette.

## 3. The "Floating Hearth" Strategy (For Lathes/Mills)

For the heaviest vibration source (e.g., a Woodturning Lathe or CNC Mill):
*   **Problem:** Even a stiff timber floor will resonate at certain RPMs.
*   **Solution:** Decouple the machine from the building entirely.
    1.  **Identify Location:** Mark the exact spot for the machine.
    2.  **Frame Around:** Build the floor joists *around* this rectangle, leaving a void.
    3.  **Cast Concrete:** Pour a **100-150mm Reinforced Concrete Pad** directly onto the compacted hardcore/ground inside the void.
    4.  **Isolate:** Ensure a **10-15mm gap** between the concrete pad and the timber floor frame. Fill with flexible cork or expansion foam.
    5.  **Mount:** Bolt the machine to the concrete.
    *   *Result:* 100% vibration isolation. The machine hits "infinite mass" (the earth). The workshop floor remains dead quiet.

## 4. Anti-Vibration Pads (Sylomer)

If a floating hearth is impossible:
*   **Material:** **Sylomer® (Getzner)** - a microcellular polyurethane elastomer.
*   **Application:** Place pads under machine feet.
*   **Sizing:** You must match the *static load* (kg) to the specific Sylomer grade (Yellow/Green/Red). If the pad is too stiff, it transmits vibration. If too soft, the machine wobbles.
*   **Generic Alternative:** **Rubber Conveyor Belting** or **Horse Stall Mats** (18mm vulcanized rubber). Cheap and effective for general woodworking machines (saws/planers).

**Recommendation:**
1.  **Floor:** 47x195mm C24 Joists @ 300mm centers.
2.  **Skin:** 12mm OSB bottom + 22mm P5 Top (Glued/Screwed Torsion Box).
3.  **Heavy Machines:** Use **Floating Concrete Hearth** for the Lathe/CNC. Use **Rubber Mats** for Table Saw/Planer.

**Confidence Rating:** 5/5 (Structural Engineering Principles).
