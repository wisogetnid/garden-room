# Dust Extraction Physics: Small Workshop Strategy

**Context:**
- **Room Volume:** 50m³ (20m² x 2.5m).
- **Primary Dust:** Mixed Wood (Hardwood/Softwood) + MDF (Hazardous).
- **Ducting:** 100mm (4") runs, approx 5m max length.

## 1. The Physics of Air Movement (CFM vs. Static Pressure)

**The Rule of 4000 FPM:**
To keep wood chips entrained (floating) in the air stream and prevent clogging, air velocity must be maintain at **4000 Feet Per Minute (FPM)** in branches.
*   **100mm Duct Area:** 0.0873 ft².
*   **Required CFM at Tool:** $4000 \times 0.0873 \approx 350 \text{ CFM}$.

**System Resistance (Static Pressure Loss):**
*   **5m Straight Duct:** ~0.5" WG loss.
*   **2x 90° Elbows:** ~0.5" WG loss.
*   **2m Flex Hose (Ribbed):** ~1.5" WG loss (Huge drag!).
*   **Total SP Loss:** ~2.5 - 3.0" WG.
*   **Extractor Requirement:** You need a machine that delivers **real 350-400 CFM at 3" Static Pressure**.
    *   *1HP Units:* Typically stall at 1-2" SP. **Avoid**.
    *   *2HP (1.5kW) Units:* Typically rated 1000-1500 CFM (free air). Real performance at 3" SP is often ~600-700 CFM. **Target Spec.**

## 2. Cyclone vs. Single Stage (Bag)

**Single Stage (The "Bag on a Stick"):**
*   **Mechanism:** Chips pass *through* the impeller.
*   **Flaw:** The bag is the filter. As fine dust coats the bag (cake), airflow drops drastically (often <50% in 10 mins).
*   **Health Risk:** Standard cloth bags pass 5-30 micron dust (the invisible dangerous stuff) right back into your lungs.

**Two-Stage (Cyclone Separator):**
*   **Mechanism:** Centrifugal force spins heavy chips into a bin *before* the filter.
*   **Benefit:** Only the finest dust reaches the filter.
*   **Efficiency:** Suction remains constant (no clogging).
*   **Impeller Protection:** Steel screws/knots don't hit the fan.
*   **Filtration:** Usually paired with a **Pleated HEPA/M-Class Cartridge** (0.5 - 1 micron).
*   **Verdict:** **MANDATORY** for a safe modern workshop.

## 3. Ducting & Static Electricity

**The "Explosion" Myth:**
In a 100mm residential system, dust concentration is too low to explode from a static spark. The real risk is annoyance (shocks) and external dust accumulation.
*   **PVC Pipe:** Cheap, smooth bore (low friction). Generates high static.
*   **Spiral Metal:** Professional, grounded, expensive.
*   **Antistatic Flex:** PU (Polyurethane) hose with a copper wire helix.
*   **Solution:** Use **100mm Soil Pipe (PVC)** for straight runs. Run a bare copper wire *inside* the duct, grounded at the machine end. Use PU flex for final connections.

## 4. Filtration Standards (M-Class)

**HSE Guidelines (UK):**
*   **Hardwood/MDF Dust:** Classified as a carcinogen.
*   **Requirement:** **M-Class Filtration** (Medium Hazard).
    *   Filters 99.9% of dust.
    *   Max permeability 0.1%.
*   **Cartridge Upgrade:** If buying a standard extractor, you **must** upgrade the cloth bag to a **0.5 Micron Cartridge Filter**. This turns a "chip collector" into an "air cleaner".

## 5. Ambient Air Cleaning (The "Polisher")

Even with good extraction, ~2-5% of dust escapes.
*   **Target:** 10 Air Changes Per Hour (ACH).
*   **Room Vol:** 50m³ = 1766 ft³.
*   **Target CFM:** $(1766 \times 10) / 60 \approx 295 \text{ CFM}$.
*   **Placement:** Hang from ceiling ~1/3 way along the long wall to create a circular airflow (Coanda effect).
*   **Spec:** A unit rated for **400 CFM** (e.g. Record Power AC400, Jet AFS-500) is perfect. Run it for 30 mins after working.

**Confidence Rating:** 5/5 (Industrial Ventilation Principles).
