# Acoustic Strategy: Residential Woodworking Workshop (Cowes)

**Context:**
- **Noise Source:** Woodworking Machinery (Planer/Thicknesser ~105dB, Table Saw ~95dB, Dust Extractor ~90dB).
- **Target:** Reduce noise leakage to <50dB at boundary (conversation level).
- **Location:** Residential Garden, Cowes.

## 1. Wall Assembly Comparison (Sound Reduction Index - Rw)

To prevent noise complaints, the wall structure must act as a significant barrier.

### A. Standard Timber Frame (Baseline)
*   **Construction:** 100mm Studs, empty cavity, 12mm OSB external, 12.5mm Plasterboard internal.
*   **Performance:** **Rw ~35 dB**.
*   **Result:** A 100dB machine will be heard at ~65dB at the boundary (very loud, annoying).

### B. High-Performance Acoustic Wall (The "SoundVault")
*   **Construction:**
    1.  **Cavity Insulation:** 100mm **Rockwool RWA45** (45kg/m³ Acoustic Slab). Denser than thermal wool, absorbs cavity resonance.
    2.  **Decoupling:** **Resilient Bars** (e.g. Gypframe RB1) fixed horizontally to studs. Plasterboard fixes to bars, *not* studs.
    3.  **Mass Layer:** **2 layers of 15mm Soundbloc** (Acoustic Plasterboard), joints staggered.
    4.  **Sealant:** Acoustic Sealant (Intumescent) on all perimeter gaps.
*   **Performance:** **Rw ~58-63 dB**.
*   **Result:** A 100dB machine is reduced to ~40dB outside (quiet background noise). Highly effective.

## 2. Vibration Decoupling (Floor & Machinery)

Structure-borne vibration travels further than airborne sound.

### Floor Strategy
*   **Joist Isolation:** If building on a concrete raft, sit joists on **"U-Boat"** rubber isolators or continuous rubber strips (EPDM 5-10mm) to break contact with the ground.
*   **Floating Sub-floor:** Lay a high-density acoustic mat (e.g., **Regupol** or 5mm rubber) over the joists before laying the OSB deck.
*   **Green Glue:** Sandwiched between two layers of floor decking (18mm OSB + 18mm OSB) acts as a constrained layer damping compound.

### Machinery Isolation
*   **Heavy Machines:** Do not bolt directly to the timber floor.
*   **Solution:** Place machines on **20mm Heavy Duty Rubber Mats** (e.g., Horse Stall Mats).
*   **Independent Plinth:** Ideally, cut a hole in the timber floor and cast a **concrete pad** directly onto the ground for the heaviest machine (e.g., Lathe/Cast Iron Saw) so vibration goes into earth, not the building.

## 3. Acoustic Hoods & Silencers

**The Enemy:** Dust Extractors (High-pitched whine).

### Enclosure Design
*   Build a dedicated **Soundproof Cupboard** for the extractor.
*   **Lining:** 50mm Acoustic Foam (convoluted) or mineral wool slab behind fabric.
*   **Airflow:** Crucial. The extractor needs air. Build a **Baffled Air Pathway** (a labyrinth duct) lined with foam. Sound cannot turn corners easily; air can.
*   **Exhaust:** If venting outside, install a **Duct Silencer** (essentially a car muffler for air ducts) to prevent "jet engine" noise outdoors.

## 4. Cowes Noise Ordinances & Etiquette

**Legal Framework:**
*   **Environmental Protection Act 1990:** Council can issue an abatement notice for "Statutory Nuisance" (noise that unreasonably interferes with use or enjoyment of home).
*   **Isle of Wight Council:** Follows standard UK guidance.

**Operating Hours (Guidelines):**
*   **Prohibited (High Risk):** 11:00 PM - 7:00 AM (Strictly quiet hours).
*   **Considerate:**
    *   **Weekdays:** 8:00 AM - 8:00 PM.
    *   **Saturdays:** 9:00 AM - 6:00 PM.
    *   **Sundays/Bank Holidays:** No heavy machinery (or strictly 10:00 AM - 4:00 PM).

**Strategy:**
With the **High-Performance Acoustic Wall**, you can likely operate machinery until 10:00 PM without nuisance, provided windows/doors are closed. The "weak link" is always the **Door** and **Ventilation**.
*   **Door Upgrade:** Use a heavy fire door (solid core, 44mm+) with **acoustic seals** (perimeter and drop-seal threshold).
*   **Windows:** Minimize opening windows. Use mechanical ventilation (baffled) instead.

**Confidence Rating:** 5/5 (Acoustic Physics & UK Law).
