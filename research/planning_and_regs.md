# Planning & Regulations Audit: 20m² Workshop (Cowes, IoW)

**Context:**
- **Structure:** 20m² Detached Outbuilding (4m x 5m).
- **Location:** Cowes, Isle of Wight.
- **Use:** "Professional Woodworking Workshop".
- **Constraints:** Near boundary (likely <2m).

## 1. Permitted Development (Class E) Check

Most garden rooms fall under **Class E** of the General Permitted Development Order (GPDO).

### Key Constraints for 20m² Build:
1.  **Height Rule (The 2.5m Trap):**
    *   If any part of the building is within **2.0m of a boundary**, the maximum overall height (including roof/parapet) is restricted to **2.5m** from ground level.
    *   *Implication:* For a comfortable internal ceiling height (2.1m-2.2m), you have very little room for floor/roof insulation structure (300-400mm max). A flat roof (warm roof) is almost mandatory here.
2.  **Footprint:** Must not cover >50% of the total curtilage (garden area excluding original house).
3.  **Location:** Must not be forward of the principal elevation (front wall) of the original house.

### Article 4 Directions (Cowes):
*   **Cowes Conservation Area:** If your property is within the Conservation Area, Permitted Development rights are restricted.
    *   *Standard:* Outbuildings >10m² usually require planning permission in conservation areas if they are more than 20m from the house or to the side.
    *   *Action:* Check the [Isle of Wight Council Conservation Area Map](https://www.iow.gov.uk/). If in the zone, **Full Planning is Required**.

## 2. Usage Class: "Incidental" vs. "Business"

**The "Professional" Workshop Dilemma:**
*   **Class E Requirement:** The building must be for a purpose "incidental to the enjoyment of the dwellinghouse" (e.g., hobby, gym, storage).
*   **Business Use:** If the workshop is for a **primary trade/business** (manufacturing furniture for sale, employing staff, frequent client visits, significant noise/dust), this constitutes a **Material Change of Use** (C3 Residential to Class E(g) Commercial).
    *   *Risk:* Enforcement action to cease usage or demolish.
    *   *Solution:* If it is a "Home Business" (sole trader, no employees, no visiting clients, noise comparable to domestic hobby use), it is often tolerated without planning. If it is a full-time industrial workshop, you **Need Planning Permission**.

## 3. Building Regulations (The 15-30m² Rule)

A detached building with floor area between **15m² and 30m²** is exempt from Building Regulations **ONLY IF**:
1.  It contains no sleeping accommodation.
2.  **AND** it is at least **1m from any boundary**.
3.  **OR** it is constructed of **substantially non-combustible materials**.

**The Trap:**
A 4x5m (20m²) timber-framed workshop placed 0.5m from the fence **DOES NOT** meet the exemption criteria because timber is combustible.
*   **Result:** technically requires a Building Control Application.

**Compliance Paths:**
*   **Path A (Move it):** Place the building >1m from all boundaries. (Exempt).
*   **Path B (Make it Non-Combustible):** Build with blockwork/brick. (Exempt).
*   **Path C (Apply for Approval):** Submit a Building Notice. You will need to meet Part A (Structure), Part B (Fire), Part L (Energy - maybe), Part P (Electric).
    *   *Fire Spread (Part B):* For a timber building <1m from boundary, the facing wall must have **fire resistance** (usually 30 mins) from the *inside* (to stop fire escaping to neighbour) and have limited combustibility on the *outside*.
    *   *Solution:* Use **Cement Board Cladding** (HardiePlank/Cedral - A2 Fire Rated) on boundary walls + **15mm Fireline Plasterboard** internally.

## 4. Electrical Regulations (Part P)

**Status: NOT EXEMPT.**
*   All electrical work in a garden room (running a new supply from the main house consumer unit) is **Notifiable Work** under Part P.
*   **Requirements:**
    1.  Design/Install by a Part P registered electrician.
    2.  Or inspect/test by Building Control (expensive).
    3.  **SWA Cable:** Steel Wire Armoured cable buried >600mm deep with warning tape.
    4.  **Consumer Unit:** A small 2-way "garage unit" in the workshop with RCD/RCBO protection.

## 5. Summary Checklist
1.  **Height:** Keep <2.5m if <2m from fence.
2.  **Location:** Check Conservation Area status.
3.  **Use:** clarify "Professional" vs "Hobby". If heavy business, apply for planning.
4.  **Building Regs:** If <1m from fence, use Fire Rated Cladding (Cement Fibre) and Fire Plasterboard to satisfy Part B if you apply, or to meet the spirit of "substantially non-combustible" (though strictly timber frame fails the exemption test, many inspectors accept non-combustible cladding/lining as sufficient). *Recommendation: Submit a Building Notice to be safe/legal for resale.*

**Confidence Rating:** 5/5 (Standard UK Planning Law 2024-2026).
