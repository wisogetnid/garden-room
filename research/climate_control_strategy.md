# Climate Control Strategy: Workshop Physics

**Context:**
- **Room:** 20m² Timber Frame (Low Thermal Mass).
- **Usage:** Intermittent (Evenings/Weekends).
- **Goal:** Fast Warm-up, Low Running Cost, Summer Cooling.

## 1. The Contenders: Infrared (IR) vs. Heat Pump

**A. Infrared Panels (Radiant Heating):**
*   **Physics:** Emits electromagnetic waves that heat *surfaces* (skin, tools, floor), not the air.
*   **Efficiency (COP):** **1.0**. (1kW in = 1kW heat).
*   **Experience:** You feel warm instantly in the "beam", but the air remains cold (breath condenses).
*   **Best For:** Spot heating a workbench in a draughty barn.
*   **Workshop Verdict:** **Poor**. Shadowed areas (behind machines) stay cold. Tools rust. No cooling capability.

**B. Air-to-Air Heat Pump (Mini-Split AC):**
*   **Physics:** Moves heat from outside air to inside (Refrigeration cycle).
*   **Efficiency (COP/SCOP):** **3.5 - 5.0**. (1kW in = 4kW heat).
*   **Experience:** Blows warm air. Circulates room volume quickly.
*   **Bonus:** **Active Cooling (AC)** in summer + **Dehumidification** (Dry mode).
*   **Dust Issue:** Moving air blows dust.
    *   *Mitigation:* Use "Floor Console" units (blow from bottom) or clean filters weekly. Turn off during heavy sanding.
*   **Verdict:** **The Winner**. The efficiency and summer cooling make it the only logical choice for a high-spec garden room.

## 2. Energy Analysis: The "Warm-up" Cost

**Scenario:** Heating 20m² from 5°C to 18°C (Delta T = 13K).
*   **Heat Loss (estimated):** ~500W at 0°C outside (High insulation).
*   **Thermal Mass (Air + Lining):** ~0.5 kWh to bring up to temp.

**Comparison:**
*   **Electric Radiator (2kW):**
    *   Time to temp: ~20 mins.
    *   Energy used: 0.6 kWh.
    *   Cost (30p/kWh): **18p**.
*   **Heat Pump (2kW Output, 0.5kW Input):**
    *   Time to temp: ~15 mins (forced convection).
    *   Energy used: 0.15 kWh.
    *   Cost (30p/kWh): **4.5p**.

**Long Term:** Over 10 years, the Heat Pump pays for itself in electricity savings *and* protects tools from rust via dehumidification.

## 3. Phase Change Materials (PCM) - The "Virtual Concrete"

Timber buildings overheat rapidly in summer (Low Decrement Delay).
*   **Solution:** **PCM Boards** (e.g., BioPCM / Infinite R).
*   **Mechanism:** Paraffin/Salt Hydrate encapsulations melt at **23°C**.
*   **Effect:** As room hits 23°C, the wall "absorbs" heat to melt the wax, preventing temp rise (Latent Heat of Fusion).
*   **Capacity:** A 10mm PCM layer can equal the thermal mass of **100mm Concrete**.
*   **Recommendation:** Install PCM mats behind the plasterboard on the **South and West walls** only. This passively manages solar gain without using energy.

**Confidence Rating:** 5/5 (Thermodynamic Principles).
