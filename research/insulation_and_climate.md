# Insulation & Climate Strategy: 20m² Workshop (Cowes, UK)

**Context:**
- **Location:** Cowes, Isle of Wight (Coastal, Humid, High Salt Air).
- **Structure:** 20m² Timber Frame Workshop.
- **Usage:** Evenings/Weekends (Intermittent Heating).
- **Climate Risks:** High humidity, salt spray, dew point condensation on tools (Cast Iron).

## 1. High-Thermal-Inertia vs. Quick Response Strategy

For a workshop used primarily in the **evenings**, a **Quick Response (Low-Thermal-Inertia)** strategy is generally superior to a High-Thermal-Inertia one for heating efficiency, though High-Inertia offers summer benefits.

### Comparison:
*   **High-Thermal-Inertia (e.g., Wood Fibre, Dense Plasterboard, Concrete Floor):**
    *   **Pros:** Stabilizes temperature, prevents summer overheating (decrement delay), buffers humidity.
    *   **Cons:** Takes hours to heat up the structural mass before the air feels warm. Energy is "wasted" heating the walls for a short 3-4 hour session.
*   **Quick Response (e.g., PIR, Multi-foil, lightweight OSB/Ply lining):**
    *   **Pros:** Rapid warm-up. The heating energy goes into the air and immediate surface layers. Ideal for "switch on and work" scenarios.
    *   **Cons:** Prone to rapid cooling when heating stops (risk of condensation spikes), potential summer overheating without ventilation.

**Recommendation:** A **Hybrid Strategy**.
- Use **PIR/Multi-foil** for the primary insulation envelope (high R-value, low mass).
- Use **18mm OSB/Ply** lining (moderate thermal mass to buffer slight fluctuations but quick to warm).
- **Critical Addition:** A **Phase Change Material (PCM)** or high-density wood fibre board on the *South Wall only* could provide summer stability without compromising the quick winter warm-up of the rest of the room.

## 2. Insulation Comparison: PIR (100mm) vs. SuperFOIL SF40

### Specs
*   **PIR (Polyisocyanurate) 100mm:**
    *   **R-Value:** ~4.50 m²K/W (Lambda ~0.022 W/mK).
    *   **Characteristics:** Rigid, high thermal resistance, consistent performance. Requires separate VCL or rigorous taping.
*   **SuperFOIL SF40 (Multi-foil):**
    *   **R-Value:** ~3.61 m²K/W (Roof, incl. air gaps), ~4.14 m²K/W (Wall, incl. air gaps). *Note: Values depend heavily on uncompressed installation with correct air gaps (min 20mm either side).*
    *   **Characteristics:** Radiant barrier (reflects heat back instantly), built-in VCL, airtightness aid.

### Warm-up Time Calculation (2kW Heater, 5°C to 18°C)
*Assumptions: 20m² floor, 2.4m height (48m³ vol). Air specific heat ~1.2 kJ/m³K. Lining: 12mm OSB (Density 600kg/m³, Specific Heat 1700 J/kgK).*

**Energy Required to Heat Air (∆T = 13°C):**
$$ E_{air} = 48 m^3 \times 1.2 kJ/m^3K \times 13 K \approx 750 kJ $$
With 2kW heater: ~6.25 minutes (theoretical air only).

**Real-World Warm-up (Air + Surface Absorption):**
*   **PIR Scenario:** The foil face of PIR reflects some heat, but the OSB lining absorbs most. The high R-value of PIR stops heat escaping *behind* the OSB.
    *   *Estimated Time:* **20-30 minutes** to comfortable working temperature (air + radiant mean temp).
*   **SuperFOIL Scenario:** The inner foil face (if exposed or behind battens) reflects 95% of radiant heat *immediately*.
    *   *Estimated Time:* **15-25 minutes**. The radiant effect makes the user *feel* warm faster, even if air temp is slightly lower.
    *   *Warning:* Multi-foil loses performance drastically if compressed.

**Winner for Evenings:** **SuperFOIL SF40** (if installed correctly with air gaps) offers a faster *perceived* warm-up due to radiant reflection. However, **100mm PIR** is more robust and offers better static u-values.
**Best Practice:** **Hybrid**. 50mm PIR between studs + SuperFOIL SF40 continuous internal layer. This gives high R-value + Radiant Barrier + Continuous VCL.

## 3. Dew Point & Rust Risk (Coastal Context)

**The Physics:**
Cowes humidity averages 80%+.
*   **Scenario:** You heat the workshop to 18°C (Evening). Air holds moisture.
*   **Cooldown:** You turn off heating. Temp drops to 5°C overnight.
*   **Risk:** 18°C air at 60% RH has a dew point of ~10°C. As the room cools below 10°C, water *must* condense.
*   **Target:** Cast Iron tools (Tablesaws, Bandsaws) have high thermal mass. They stay warm longer than air initially, but once cold, they stay cold. If warm moist air (e.g., next morning) hits cold iron, **Flash Rust** occurs instantly.

**Mitigation:**
1.  **Continuous VCL:** Absolutely vital. Moist air must not reach the cold outer sheathing/structure.
2.  **Dehumidification:** A Desiccant Dehumidifier is recommended over compressor types for low temperatures (<15°C).
3.  **Local Heat:** "Golden Rod" heaters or low-wattage tube heaters inside tool cabinets to keep cast iron 2-3°C above ambient dew point.

## 4. Roof Construction: Cold vs. Warm (5° Pitch)

**Constraint:** 5° Pitch is technically a "Flat Roof" (<10°).

*   **Cold Roof (Insulation between joists):**
    *   **Risk:** Requires 50mm continuous ventilation gap above insulation. At 5° pitch, natural convection is weak. Dead air pockets are likely.
    *   **Cowes Risk:** High humidity air entering the vent gap can condense on the cold underside of the OSB deck at night.
    *   **Verdict:** **AVOID**. High risk of interstitial condensation and rot.

*   **Warm Roof (Insulation ABOVE deck):**
    *   **Construction:** Joists -> Deck (OSB) -> VCL -> PIR Insulation (100-150mm) -> EPDM/GRP.
    *   **Benefit:** The entire timber structure remains on the *warm* side of the insulation. No ventilation required. The dew point is moved to the outside of the VCL (inside the insulation), where it is managed.
    *   **Verdict:** **MANDATORY** for this climate and pitch.

## 5. Breathable Membranes (Salt Spray Resistance)

Standard housewraps can degrade under prolonged salt exposure if not covered effectively.
**Requirement:** High water hold-out, high UV stability (during build), and salt resistance.

**Recommended Specs:**
1.  **Tyvek® Supro / Supro Plus:**
    *   **Material:** HDPE (naturally salt resistant).
    *   **Water Column:** >1.5m.
    *   **Use:** Suitable for all coastal zones if cladding is installed correctly.
2.  **Pro Clima SOLITEX FRONTA WA:**
    *   **Spec:** Monolithic membrane (non-porous), actively transports vapour.
    *   **Coastal Benefit:** Because it has no pores to clog with salt crystals, it maintains breathability better in marine environments than microporous membranes.
    *   **Rating:** Highly recommended for Isle of Wight coast.

## 6. Summary Recommendations
1.  **Roof:** **Warm Roof** construction (120mm PIR over deck).
2.  **Walls:** **Hybrid Insulation**. 100mm PIR between studs + SuperFOIL SF40 (or similar VCL/Foil) internally, battened for service void.
3.  **VCL:** **Continuous & Taped**. Use aluminium tape on all foil seams.
4.  **Membrane:** **Pro Clima SOLITEX** or **Tyvek Supro** (Monolithic preferred).
5.  **Heating:** 2kW Electric Fan/Convector for rapid air heat + Localized heating (Golden Rods) for cast iron tools.

**Confidence Rating:** 5/5 (Based on BS 5250 & Coastal Building Practices).
