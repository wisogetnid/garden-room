# Sustainability and Health Audit: Garden Room Materials

## Context
**Project:** 4m x 5m Garden Room (Wood Workshop)  
**Location:** Cowes, UK  
**Goals:** Passivehaus-style energy efficiency, low humidity, healthy internal environment.

## 1. VOC Analysis: Structural Sheathing & Cladding Substrate

Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs) off-gas from building materials and can cause respiratory issues, particularly in a small, airtight workshop.

### OSB/3 (Oriented Strand Board)
*   **Composition:** Wood strands bound with adhesives (wax and synthetic resin).
*   **VOC Profile:** Modern European OSB/3 typically uses PMDI (polymeric MDI) or MUPF (melamine-urea-phenol-formaldehyde) resins. PMDI is formaldehyde-free. Most OSB/3 produced in the UK/EU meets E1 emission standards (<0.1 ppm formaldehyde).
*   **Suitability:** Excellent for structural racking.
*   **Sustainability Score:** High (uses small diameter timber/thinnings).
*   **Confidence:** 5/5

### Plywood (Structural Softwood/Hardwood)
*   **Composition:** Thin veneers glued together.
*   **VOC Profile:** Highly variable. Exterior grades (WBP) often use Phenol Formaldehyde (PF) which has lower off-gassing than Urea Formaldehyde (UF) used in interior grades. However, imported plywoods can have unreliable emission certifications.
*   **Suitability:** Strong, good screw holding.
*   **Sustainability Score:** Medium to Low (often involves old-growth logging if not FSC/PEFC certified; longer transport distances).
*   **Confidence:** 4/5

### Medite Tricoya (Acetylated MDF)
*   **Composition:** Softwood fibres treated with acetic anhydride (acetylation) to alter the wood's chemical structure, reducing ability to absorb water. Bound with pMDI resin.
*   **VOC Profile:** Extremely low. The acetylation process does not introduce VOCs, and pMDI is formaldehyde-free. Medite Tricoya Extreme is often marketed as "Zero Added Formaldehyde" (NAF).
*   **Suitability:** Incredible durability and dimensional stability (50-year guarantee). Perfect for cladding or external facias. Expensive.
*   **Sustainability Score:** High (durable, non-toxic, uses FSC timber, but energy-intensive production process).
*   **Confidence:** 5/5

**Recommendation:** Use **OSB/3** for internal structural sheathing due to cost-effectiveness and low modern VOC levels. Use **Medite Tricoya** for external facing elements where longevity is critical.

## 2. Embodied Carbon: Cladding Options

### Siberian Larch (Imported)
*   **Origin:** Russia/Siberia.
*   **Carbon Footprint:** High due to transportation distances. The durability is natural (slow-grown), but the political and environmental cost of transport is significant.
*   **Status:** Currently restricted/sanctioned in many markets; supply chain issues.
*   **Confidence:** 4/5

### Thermally Modified British Ash (e.g., Vastern Brimstone)
*   **Origin:** UK (Domestic).
*   **Carbon Footprint:** Low transport emissions. Thermal modification requires energy (heat ~200°C), but this is often offset by the reduced transport and the utilization of a species (Ash) that is currently being felled in large numbers due to Ash Dieback, turning a potential waste product into a building material.
*   **Durability:** Class 1-2 (Very Durable).
*   **Confidence:** 4/5

### Box Profile Steel
*   **Composition:** Galvanized steel with polymer coating.
*   **Carbon Footprint:** High production energy (mining, smelting, rolling). Steel has significantly higher embodied carbon per kg than timber.
*   **Durability:** Excellent (20-40 years).
*   **Confidence:** 5/5

**Recommendation:** **Thermally Modified British Ash**. It supports the local forestry economy, utilizes timber affected by dieback, has low transport miles, and offers a beautiful, durable finish comparable to tropical hardwoods without the ecological impact.

## 3. End of Life: Roofing Materials

### EPDM (Rubber Membrane)
*   **Lifespan:** 50+ years.
*   **Recyclability:** Difficult. EPDM is a cross-linked thermoset rubber, meaning it cannot be easily melted down and reformed. End-of-life options are usually downcycling (shredding for playground surfaces/fuel) or landfill.
*   **Installation:** Cold applied (safe), single sheet (low failure risk).
*   **Confidence:** 5/5

### Zinc (Standing Seam)
*   **Lifespan:** 80-100 years.
*   **Recyclability:** Excellent. Zinc is 100% recyclable without loss of properties. It has a high scrap value, ensuring it is collected and reused rather than landfilled.
*   **Embodied Energy:** High initial embodied energy, but amortized over a very long lifespan.
*   **Confidence:** 5/5

**Recommendation:** For a DIY build on a budget, **EPDM** is the pragmatic choice despite lower recyclability. However, if the "Sustainability" goal prioritizes circular economy principles and budget permits, **Zinc** (or Aluminium as a cheaper alternative) is superior. Given the 2.5m height restriction (PD rights), a flat roof is likely, where EPDM is standard.

## Summary Recommendations for Cowes Workshop

1.  **Structure:** FSC-certified Timber frame with **OSB/3** sheathing (sealed with airtight tapes for Passivehaus standard).
2.  **Cladding:** **Thermally Modified British Ash** (or UK-grown Larch/Cedar if budget is tight) to minimize carbon miles.
3.  **Roof:** **EPDM** for practical DIY installation and watertightness on a flat roof, unless budget allows for metal roofing.
4.  **Insulation:** (Further research needed, but consider wood fibre for breathability and heat decrement).
