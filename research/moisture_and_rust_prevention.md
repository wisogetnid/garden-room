# Moisture & Anti-Corrosion Research: Coastal Timber Workshop (Cowes, UK)

**Status:** DRAFT  
**Date:** 2026-02-28  
**Author:** Opencode Agent  
**Context:** 20m² Timber Workshop, Unheated/Intermittent Heating, Cowes (Isle of Wight).

## 1. Executive Summary
Building a timber workshop in Cowes presents a "perfect storm" for corrosion: high salinity (sea salt), high humidity, and intermittent heating. The primary goal is to create a **sealed, controlled internal environment** that is decoupled from the external coastal atmosphere. The strategy relies on **airtightness** to prevent salt ingress, **hygrothermal buffering** to manage internal moisture, and **micro-climate control** for expensive tools.

## 2. Dew Point Analysis: Intermittent Heating
### The Scenario
- **Daytime:** Unheated. Structure cools to near ambient temperature.
- **Evening:** Rapid heating to 18°C.
- **Wall Buildup:** 100mm PIR Insulation.

### The Risk
When the heating is turned on, the air temperature rises faster than the structural temperature. Warm air holds more moisture. If this warm, moist air contacts a cold surface (like a tool or the cold side of the insulation), condensation occurs immediately.

With **100mm PIR**, the temperature gradient is steep.
- **Dew Point Location:** Without a Vapour Control Layer (VCL), the dew point will sit roughly **20-30mm into the insulation from the cold side** (external face).
- **Consequence:** Interstitial condensation will form *inside* the wall, potentially rotting the timber frame over time as it cannot easily dry out in winter.
- **Mitigation:** A robust VCL is mandatory to stop warm, moist internal air from entering the wall assembly.

## 3. Membrane Specification

### Internal: Variable Diffusion Membrane (Recommended)
**Specification:** **Pro Clima INTELLO Plus** (or equivalent humidity-variable membrane).
*   **Function:**
    *   **Winter (Diffusion Tight):** Acts as a high-performance VCL (diffusion resistance > 100 MNs/g) to prevent internal moisture from entering the cold wall structure.
    *   **Summer (Diffusion Open):** The molecular structure opens up (diffusion resistance drops to < 0.25 MNs/g) to allow any moisture trapped *inside* the wall to dry back *inwards* towards the room.
*   **Why for this project?** In a coastal environment, "reverse diffusion" (solar drive pushing moisture inwards) is a real risk. A standard polythene VCL traps this moisture, causing rot. INTELLO allows the wall to "breathe" safely.

### External: Marine-Grade Breather Membrane
**Specification:** **DuPont™ Tyvek® Supro (Coastal/Plus)**.
*   **Key Features:**
    *   **Class W1 Water Resistance:** Critical for driving coastal rain.
    *   **Windtight:** Prevents "thermal bypass" (cold wind washing through insulation), which degrades thermal performance by up to 40%.
    *   **Salt Resistance:** Standard membranes can degrade under salt spray; Tyvek's HDPE structure is inherently chemically resistant.
*   **Detail:** Must be taped at all laps (using Tyvek Acrylic Tape) to ensure a windtight seal.

## 4. Tool Protection: Micro-Climates

### Area Dehumidification: Desiccant vs. Compressor
**Recommendation:** **Desiccant Dehumidifier** (e.g., Meaco DD8L Zambezi).
*   **The Physics:**
    *   *Compressor Dehumidifiers:* Rely on cold coils to condense water. Below 15°C, the coils freeze, and the unit spends most of its time in "defrost" mode, extracting almost no water.
    *   *Desiccant Dehumidifiers:* Use a chemical absorbent wheel and a heater. They operate with **constant efficiency down to 1°C**.
*   **Bonus:** The desiccant process generates heat (~10-12°C rise in outlet air), providing background warmth to the workshop.
*   **Running Cost:** Higher wattage than compressors, but runs for significantly less time to achieve the same dryness in cold conditions.

### Cabinet Protection: "GoldenRod" Alternative
**Recommendation:** **Low-Wattage Tubular Heaters** (e.g., Hylite Eco Tube, 45W-80W).
*   **Strategy:** Install inside the main tool cabinet/cupboard.
*   **Mechanism:** Gently warms the air inside the cabinet to **2-3°C above ambient**. This keeps the relative humidity (RH) inside the cabinet lower than the general room RH and prevents the tools from ever reaching the dew point.
*   **VCI Emitters:** As a backup, use **Zerust VCI (Vapour Corrosion Inhibitor)** capsules in drawers. These release molecules that form a molecular barrier on metal surfaces.

## 5. Ventilation vs. Rust

### The Trade-off
*   **Passive Vents:** In Cowes, passive vents bring in air that is effectively a "salt spray aerosol". This is disastrous for cast iron tables.
*   **MVHR (Mechanical Ventilation with Heat Recovery):**
    *   *Benefit:* Filters the incoming air (removing salt/particulates) and warms it using the outgoing stale air.
    *   *Size:* For 20m², a **Single Room MVHR (dMVHR)** unit (e.g., Prana, Vent-Axia Lo-Carbon Tempra) is sufficient. It avoids the complexity of full ducting while providing filtered, tempered fresh air.
    *   *Recommendation:* Use a dMVHR unit with an **F7 or G4 filter** to catch salt particles.

### Dust as a Sponge
*   **Mechanism:** Wood dust is hygroscopic. If allowed to settle on cast iron, it absorbs moisture from the air and holds it against the metal, causing deep pitting corrosion (worse than surface rust).
*   **Protocol:** High-quality dust extraction (H-Class vacuum for hand tools) is not just for health; it is a primary anti-corrosion strategy.

## 6. Floor & Ground Moisture Detail

### The Sole Plate Junction
The connection between the concrete slab and timber frame is the primary entry point for rising damp.

1.  **DPC (Damp Proof Course):** A bituminous or polymeric DPC must sit strictly **under** the timber sole plate.
2.  **DPM (Damp Proof Membrane):** The 1200-gauge floor membrane must lap **up** the side of the concrete upstand.
3.  **The Overlap:**
    *   The floor DPM should be lapped **over** the DPC and onto the internal face of the sole plate.
    *   **Sealing:** This joint must be sealed with **double-sided butyl tape** (e.g., Pro Clima DUO tape) to create a gas-tight seal. This prevents ground moisture from bypassing the DPC.
4.  **Perimeter Insulation:** Ensure the 100mm floor PIR creates a continuous thermal break with the wall PIR to prevent a "cold bridge" at the floor perimeter, which would otherwise be a condensation magnet.
