# Moisture & Rust Prevention: The Coastal Workshop

**Context:**
- **Location:** Cowes (Sea Air, High Salinity, High RH).
- **Target:** Cast Iron Machinery (Rusts at >65% RH + Condensation).
- **Construction:** Timber Frame (Must breathe).

## 1. Dew Point Analysis (The Rust Mechanism)

**Scenario:** 18°C Evening Session -> 5°C Overnight.
*   **Air at 18°C / 60% RH:** Holds ~9g water/m³. Dew Point = **10°C**.
*   **Cooldown:** As the workshop cools below 10°C, the air becomes saturated (100% RH).
*   **Result:** Water condenses on the coldest massive objects (Cast Iron Saw Tables).
*   **Reaction:** Water + Oxygen + Salt (Cowes Air) + Iron = **Flash Rust** by morning.

**Strategy:**
1.  **Lower the RH:** Remove water from the air before it cools.
2.  **Raise the Surface Temp:** Keep the iron warmer than the dew point.

## 2. Dehumidification: Desiccant is King

**Compressor Dehumidifiers:**
*   **Mechanism:** Refrigeration coils.
*   **Flaw:** Below 15°C, coils ice up. Efficiency drops to near zero in unheated workshops.
*   **Verdict:** **Useless** for this application.

**Desiccant Dehumidifiers (e.g., Meaco DD8L):**
*   **Mechanism:** Zeolite absorption wheel + Heater regeneration.
*   **Performance:** Works effectively down to **1°C**.
*   **Bonus:** The regeneration process releases warm air (~10-12°C rise at outlet). Acts as a background heater (600W).
*   **Recommendation:** Run a Desiccant unit on "Auto" (Target 50% RH) 24/7. Use the drain hose to pipe water outside (sink/drain).

## 3. Membrane Technology: Intelligent Vapor Control

**Standard VCL (Polythene):**
*   **Risk:** If moisture gets into the wall (leaky cladding/roof), it is trapped forever. Rot ensues.

**Intelligent Membrane (Pro Clima INTELLO):**
*   **Feature:** Humidity-variable diffusion resistance (Sd value).
*   **Winter:** Sd > 10m (High resistance). Stops internal moisture entering the wall.
*   **Summer:** Sd < 0.25m (Low resistance). Allows any trapped moisture in the wall to dry *inwards* into the room (where the dehumidifier removes it).
*   **Verdict:** **Essential** for long-term structural health in a coastal timber frame.

## 4. Tool Protection: "Golden Rods" & Wax

**Local Heating:**
Even with a dehumidifier, rapid temp swings can cause condensation.
*   **Solution:** **Golden Rod** (15-25W Heater Bar).
*   **Placement:** Inside the cabinet of the Table Saw / Bandsaw or mounted under the cast iron wing.
*   **Effect:** Convection keeps the iron ~3-5°C warmer than ambient air. Prevents condensation forming.

**Barrier Protection:**
*   **Paste Wax:** Apply Liberty's / Renaissance Wax to all cast iron surfaces weekly.
*   **Cover:** Throw a cotton sheet over machines when not in use (stops settling dust absorbing moisture). *Do not use plastic sheets (traps condensation).*

## 5. Ventilation Strategy (MVHR vs. Sealed)

**The Conflict:**
Ventilation is needed for Oxygen (Occupant) and VOC removal. But Cowes winter air is 90% RH. Bringing it in *adds* moisture.
*   **Occupied Mode:** Turn on **Single Room MVHR** (e.g., Blauberg Vento). Recovers heat, provides fresh air.
*   **Unoccupied Mode:** **SEAL THE ROOM**. Turn off vents. Rely 100% on the Desiccant Dehumidifier to maintain 50% RH. Do not ventilate an empty workshop in winter.

**Confidence Rating:** 5/5 (Psychrometric Physics).
